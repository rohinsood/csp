<p>There was one discrepancy between my grading and CollegeBoard’s. I gave the student the point for program purpose and function because they stated that it “provided infomration on a triangle based on inputted side lengths”. I believe that this, along with their additional commentary, did satisfy the requirements for the overall purpose of the program. In order to ensure that I satisfy this requirement, I will throughly explain the purpose of my program and all of its features. I will use technical terminology to clearly convey my knowledge of the topic. A submission may fail to meet this criteria because they fail to discuss the functionality and output of their program appropriately. They were given a 0 out of 1 because there is no partial credit.</p>

<p>I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for the 2nd performance task submission. The student clearly meets all criteria required for a 6/6 and had the necessary code and explanations to achieve this score. In my own work, I will ensure that I create mutliple procedures with parameters to manipulate lists. Lists are a large part of the CollegeBoard APCSP requirements, so I’ll add lots of data abstraction methods using them. There is no partial credit awarded, so I will make sure to follow every single requirement exactly. The student who created this CPT did just that.</p>
