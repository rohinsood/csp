<ul>
  <li>Javascript visualizations
    <ul>
      <li>Using algorithms, data structures, such as 2D arrays and dictionaries can be easily visualized</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User interaction
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive and kinetic learning makes for stronger lessons &amp; ability to teach</li>
