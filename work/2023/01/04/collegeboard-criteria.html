    <tr>
      <td>Program Purpose and Function</td>
      <td>1. They include the program function, the input and the output. Their video demonstrates this effectively. Their written response describes the overall purpose</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Abstraction</td>
      <td>1. Names the variable of a list/collection data type. States what is inside said data type. List has more than 1 element. Describes what the elements in the list represent.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Managing Complexity</td>
      <td>0. This doesn’t exactly manage complexity, as the gathering of different names doesn’t manage the different complex parts of the code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
      <td>1. The student correctly defines a student-developed function not placed in any language specifically. Shows complete function definition and calling the function in a multiplicity of areas.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
      <td>1. The Student correctly demonstrates the usage of sequencing, selection and iteration throughout their program by running through multiple different function calls adn how each is selected.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Reflection: At first I was unaware of the necessary definition of “operation” and what College Board meant by “purpose”. Seeing that the purpose earned a 0 was insightful to how I will hopefully eventually write my own performance task.</p>

    <tr>

      <td>1. Identifies the criteria the game is based upon, what the program’s inputs are (specifically) and specifically delineates what the program outputs and its functionality</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Abstraction</td>
      <td>1. Multiple lists are demonstrated to exist and their various contents are explained and the data types analyzed. This meets all the requirements to this point.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Managing Complexity</td>
      <td>1. This program uses a list in order to store the binary status of every item on the grid. This being unable to be done otherwise, this correctly manages complexity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
      <td>1. Utilizes the procedure place cell and describes the function call, parameters, function, and output of the program. Correctly describes usage of the procedure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
      <td>1. Correctly describes the utilization of an algorithm and how the algorithm processes different inputs by using various different function calls. Then proceeds to demonstrate the logic.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Reflection: I now see the extent to which College Boards wants a proper “purpose” to one’s program. This purpose should appropriate reflect the why, not necessarily the how.</p>
