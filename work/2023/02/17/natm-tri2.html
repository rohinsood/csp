<p>Night at the Museum was an enjoyable experience this trimester! I had a great time exploring various projects and presenting our own to fellow participants. Despite our project still being a work in progress, it was inspiring to witness the success of other participants’ projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arcade
    <ul>
      <li>The arcade owned by Chinmay and Emaad featured a variety of games, including hangman and a nation guesser. There were a lot of features in this arcade, and I think they kept a lot of data in the backend.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rental Retreat
    <ul>
      <li>Krishiv made an app that allows users to select a location and a house from that location based on their wants and needs. Their backend seemed very complex and it was a very cool app!</li>

<p>I met a ton of my friends and even new people when I looked at various projects. These projects were super cool even though many of them (including our own) were not finished. I’d have really liked if tri 2 could have moved around some breaks to accommodate completed projects, because that would make N@TM so much more entertaining. Pertaining to other classes, I was surprised and disappointed not to see any business materials from Mr.Buxton, as he and his classes are some of my favorite on campus. I overall believe that the day would have been better if we had a bit more done, but overall, it was a fine day. 7/10.</p>
