#### Dopamine Issues

**Real?**
In my opinion, dopamine is a genuine factor and contributes to various problems, particularly among social media users. Social media attracts individuals to crave for constant engagement. Every time an individual receives a notification on their phone, they experience a rush of dopamine and excitement. For instance, receiving likes on social media posts can evoke feelings of happiness and validation for many people.

**Parent Conspiracy?**
Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is a scientifically verified concept with real-life examples, such as the story of Anthony Rosner, showcasing its effects.

**Dopamine in My Life**

I realized that excessive video gaming and TikTok watching was negatively impacting my academic performance. I used to spend 2 hours a night, 10 hours a week on video games before realizing the harm it was causing. I gradually reduced my gaming until I quit completely to improve my school-life balance. Similar to video games, TikTok was also consuming a lot of my time and distracting me. So, I deleted the app for the same reason. To counter the dopamine addiction, I adopted healthier habits like reading, drawing, and doing homework during breaks. These changes helped me to overcome my dopamine dependency and improved my daily life.

## Blog Post Reflection

### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Individuals can enhance their digital literacy by being proficient in basic commands. For instance, if a teacher is moving quickly during a lecture and the material is available on my computer, I can quickly capture it with the "command + shift + 3" screenshot command. Additionally, for computer science classes, if I need to record a video, I can utilize the "command + shift + 5" screen recording command.

### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

An individual with strong knowledge can empower others by assisting students who may have limited understanding. At DNHS, I can contribute by offering tutoring to lower grade students or those taking classes I have already completed.

### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Red tape, not paper, may be hindering digital empowerment. Excessive bureaucratic procedures can prolong the digital process and slow down its progress. At Del Norte, certain restrictions are blocking digital empowerment.
