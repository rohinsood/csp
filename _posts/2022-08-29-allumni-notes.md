### Summary
This panel of students helped me to understand that computer science is a competitive and vastly applicable field. In majors such as mechanical engineering, aerospace, and cognitivie science computer science is prominently utilized. It's important to stay motivated and not be discouraged by errors that you don't understand at the moment or by otherss far beyond your capabilities. I've learned that computer science isn't a sprint, its a slow and steady marathon and those who take their time to fully comprehend it will win!
