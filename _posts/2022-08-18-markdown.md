Below are a few things that you can do with markdown

## You can *style* __text__ ~~using~~ *markdown*!


## And have HTML Fragments!
<details>
<summary>Click me!!</summary>
<table style="text-align: center;">
  <tr>
    <th>This is a table made in HTML!</th>
    <th>🤣</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>😁</td>
    <td>🥺</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

## And code embeds!
```java
public class Calculator {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

    double first_num = sc.nextDouble();
    double second_num = sc.nextDouble();
    
    System.out.println(first_num + second_num);
  }
}
```

## And images!
