  - > **Collaboration**
    
      - > Helps people learn from each other
        
          - > Diverse perspectives that avoid bias in computing development
            
              - > For example, if the product is used by short and tall people, hiring only tall people to work on the product could bring bias; hiring both short and tall people brings new perspectives that may not have been achieved otherwise
        
          - > Companies hire ppl who can code and have good collaboration skills
        
          - > Effective collaboration can help one gain insight and knowledge by applying multiple perspectives, experiences, and skillsets
    
      - > Collaboration is a learned skill
        
          - > Includes communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, & negotiation
    
      - > Collaboration can make others more self-aware
        
          - > Matches weaknesses with someone elses strengths -\> better product and new insight
    
      - > Facilitates the solving of computational problems by applying multiple perspectives and skill sets
        
          - > Combines different peoples resources. Talents & experiences
    
      - > Not limited by location
        
          - > Current computational tools allow people in diff physical locations to share data & info

  - > **How programs function**
    
      - > ***Program*** is often referred to as ***software***
        
          - > A collection of prgram statements that perform a specific task when run byt hte computer
        
          - > Software is a set of instructions data or pgrams used to operate computers and execute specific tasks
    
      - > Difficult to determine if a program works for every condition
    
      - > Programmers can never have too many test cases
        
          - > Logical errors demonstrate why collaboration si so important in programming
        
          - > Common that a fresh set of eyes will be better than an entrenched programmer
    
      - > A complex program can be described broadly by what it does
        
          - > Keeping the program ***abstract*** helps the user focus on using the program instead of looking at the code
            
              - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image1.png)
        
          - > GUI is an example of abstraction, doesn’t show the user how it works

  - > **Program Input**
    
      - > This is data sent to a computer for processing by a program
        
          - > Can come in multiple forms:
            
              - > ***Tactile***
                
                  - > User interaction
            
              - > Audio
            
              - > Visual
            
              - > Text
        
          - > Example of input/output
            
              - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image7.png)
            
              - > User says “hey phone” - triggers an ***event***
                
                  - > The action that supplies input data to a program
                    
                      - > Key press
                    
                      - > Mouse click
                    
                      - > Program is started
                    
                      - > Anu other dewfinmed action taht affects the flow of execution

  - > **Development process**
    
      - > Can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature
        
          - > A development process that is ***iterative*** requires refine ment and revisions based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process, this may require revisiting earlier phases of the process
            
              - > **\#1) investigating and reflecting ↡**
            
              - > **\#2 designing ↡**
            
              - > **\#3) prototyping ↡**
            
              - > **\#4) testing ↻**
        
          - > Example
            
              - > *\#1) due to location restrictions, there is a large need for an effective way of communicating with a team*
            
              - > *\#2) design the steps needed to develop the multiple algorithms that allow for certain functionalities such as video conferencing*
            
              - > *\#3) write the program*
            
              - > *\#4) Execute the program to find errors*
            
              - > This process will be repeated until an acceptable product is reached or the programmer just runs out of time
    
      - > A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem ito smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole
        
          - > A program rarely works on the first development and breaking it into smaller parts of the code reduces the debugging process
        
          - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image9.png)
        
          - > Once they work, add the small chunks of code together to form the bigger program
    
      - > The DESIGN of a program incorporates investigations to determine its reqs
        
          - > Most programs are for ppl not progs and to meet the needs of ppl, investigation mus tidentify the prgram constraints & the concerns and interested of people who will uise the program
        
          - > Example of perfomraing investigation
            
              - > Colecting data in surveys

              - > Creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
            
              - > Developing a testing strat for the program

  - > **Program Documentation**
    
      - > A written desc of the func of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed
    
      - > Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming envs
        
          - > Progs should document a program throughout its development - helps them rember what they were thinking
    
      - > ***Comments***
        
          - > Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs
        
          - > Do not affect run speed
    
      - > Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else
        
          - > Should include the origin or authors name

  - > **Program Errors**
    
      - > Three types of errors can occur
        
          - > ***Logic error***
            
              - > Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly
        
          - > ***Syntax Error***
            
              - > Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed
        
          - > ***Runtime Error***
            
              - > Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program
            
              - > Prog langs define their own runtime errors

**Big Idea 2: Data**

  - > **Bits represent data**
    
      - > ***Bit***
        
          - > Shorthand for a single binary digit and is etierh 0 or 1
    
      - > ***Byte***
        
          - > 8 bits
        
          - > 0111 0011 - contains 1 byte and 8 bits
    
      - > ***Binary sequences***
        
          - > Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs.
        
          - > variable length
            
              - > Example
                
                  - > Colors
                
                  - > Boolean logic
                
                  - > Lists & so on
    
      - > Some data may take many bits to represent it
        
          - > For example:
            
              - > 10 ***MP*** uses 10,000,000 ***pixels***
                
                  - > 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits
                
                  - > MP is one billion pixels
            
              - > This means that there are 8 bits \* 6 bytes \* 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture.
                
                  - > (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec)

  - > **Abstractions**
    
      - > Bits are grouped to represent abstractions
        
          - > EX:
            
              - > Numbers
            
              - > Chars
            
              - > Colors
            
              - > & so on
    
      - > Abstractions find common features to generalize the program
        
          - > Helps to shrink code & reduces the chance of error
        
          - > Example:
            
              - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image16.png)
            
              - > The programming language is an abstraction of machine code & makes it easier to do stuff like add nums

  - > **Analog vs digital data**
    
      - > ***Ananalog signal***
        
          - > has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals
        
          - > Ex:
            
              - > Pitch
            
              - > Volume
            
              - > Colors
            
              - > Position of a sprinter during a race
        
          - > CONTINUOUS SIGNALS
    
      - > ***Digital signals***
        
          - > An analog signal that has been broken up into steps
        
          - > Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a ***sampling*** technique,
            
              - > measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample
            
              - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image11.png)

  - > (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction)

  - > Consequences of using bits to represent data
    
      - > A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value
        
          - > Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val
        
          - > EG:
            
              - > Integer: 4
            
              - > Real Number: 4.00
            
              - > Boolean: True | False
            
              - > String: “Novak the third”
            
              - > List: \[1, 1, 35, 6\]
        
          - > Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits
            
              - > Limits the num range of int vals & math operations on such values
            
              - > Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error
            
              - > AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer’s memory
            
              - > KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM

  - > **Number Systems**
    
      - > Bin, decimal, & hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data
    
      - > KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM
    
      - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image4.png)

  - > **Various Errors**
    
      - > Several diff types of erroos can occur:
        
          - > ***Overflow Errors***
            
              - > In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits
            
              - > when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number
            
              - > EX:
                
                  - > On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7<sub>dec</sub>)
                
                  - > Running smth like
                    
                      - > x=7
                    
                      - > Y = x++
                
                  - > Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw
        
          - > ***Run-time errors***
            
              - > A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run
                
                  - > EX: Accessing undeclared vars
        
          - > ***Roundoff errors***
            
              - > Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another
                
                  - > EX: ⅓ = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ⅓ 0.3333 on a diff comp

  - > **Lossy and Lossless Data compressions**
    
      - > Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data
        
          - > (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info)
    
      - > Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs
    
      - > ***Lossy Compression***
        
          - > Can significantly reduce the file size for storage and transmission
        
          - > Trade-off is that u will not recover the original file & SOME data will always be lost
        
          - > Used in sitch where minimizing transmission time & data size is important
    
      - > ***Lossless Compression***
        
          - > NO DATA IS LOST
        
          - > Trade off is larger files that can be harder to store, transfer, and handle
        
          - > Used in sitch where quality or ability to reconstruct the orig file is important
    
      - > ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-csp/media/image12.png)

  - > **Information Extracted from Data**
    
      - > Computer programs can be used to process info & gain insight & knowledge
        
          - > Info can include digital data such as
            
              - > Geographic data
            
              - > Premium data on social med sites based on usage
    
      - > ***Information***
        
          - > The collection of facts and patterns extracted from data
    
      - > Gaining insight from the above valuable involves a combination of…
        
          - > Statistics
        
          - > Mathematics
        
          - > Programming
        
          - > And problem solving
    
      - > Large data sets may be analyzed computationally to reveal…
        
          - > Patterns
        
          - > Trends
        
          - > Associations
        
          - > (can me bisinterpereted)
        
          - > (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists)
            
              - > (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature)
    
      - > The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted
        
          - > A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion
        
          - > Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion
    
      - > Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case)
    
      - > Data sets pose challenges regardless of size:
        
          - > The need to clean data
            
              - > Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything
        
          - > Incomplete data
        
          - > Invalid data
        
          - > The need to combine data sources
    
      - > Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications
        
          - > (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools)
