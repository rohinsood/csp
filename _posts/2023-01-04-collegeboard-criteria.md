## Video/Review 1

| Section | Grade (1 or 0) |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. They include the program function, the input and the output. Their video demonstrates this effectively. Their written response describes the overall purpose |
| Data Abstraction | 1. Names the variable of a list/collection data type. States what is inside said data type. List has more than 1 element. Describes what the elements in the list represent. |
| Managing Complexity | 0. This doesn't exactly manage complexity, as the gathering of different names doesn't manage the different complex parts of the code. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. The student correctly defines a student-developed function not placed in any language specifically. Shows complete function definition and calling the function in a multiplicity of areas. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. The Student correctly demonstrates the usage of sequencing, selection and iteration throughout their program by running through multiple different function calls adn how each is selected. |


Reflection: At first I was unaware of the necessary definition of "operation" and what College Board meant by "purpose". Seeing that the purpose earned a 0 was insightful to how I will hopefully eventually write my own performance task. 

## Video/Review 2

| Section | Grade (1 or 0) |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1. Identifies the criteria the game is based upon, what the program's inputs are (specifically) and specifically delineates what the program outputs and its functionality |
| Data Abstraction | 1. Multiple lists are demonstrated to exist and their various contents are explained and the data types analyzed. This meets all the requirements to this point. |
| Managing Complexity | 1. This program uses a list in order to store the binary status of every item on the grid. This being unable to be done otherwise, this correctly manages complexity.  | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1. Utilizes the procedure place cell and describes the function call, parameters, function, and output of the program. Correctly describes usage of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly describes the utilization of an algorithm and how the algorithm processes different inputs by using various different function calls. Then proceeds to demonstrate the logic. |

Reflection: I now see the extent to which College Boards wants a proper "purpose" to one's program. This purpose should appropriate reflect the why, not necessarily the how.
