Although the night of the museum event was only a 30 minute shift, I was able to view other classmates and other period’s projects. My group got a lot of feedback from other students as our project was not fully 100% finished. We got more inspiration from other projects. For example, changing the aesthetics of our project, adding more features such as a comment area, where you could comment on the different options of teams that we had. There especially was this one parent that questioned us about the mechanics and overall code and we were able to give them a satisfactory response and they gave us a suggestion on changing the colors of our site. I also had fun talking to others from other classes and socializing with those that weren’t in CSP and they all decided to take it next year.
