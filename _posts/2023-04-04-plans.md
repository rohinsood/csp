# What I plan to work on
 - Javascript visualizations
   - Using algorithms, data structures, such as 2D arrays and dictionaries can be easily visualized
 - User interaction
   - Interactive and kinetic learning makes for stronger lessons & ability to teach
 - I applied such visualization in my CPT project from last year, perhaps I can revamp it to be more tailored towards teaching
