### Python Check

To show that my python code works through Jupyter Notebook by using my old Rapid API code. This program is running on fastpages and printing the output on the fastpages blog, using anaconda kernel.

### Make Server

The ```make server``` command starts a live server based on the fastpages being updated right away using docker containers.

### Binary Code Check

We used this this binary code from Mr. Mort's fastpages to visualize how binary works and how the power of two is represented. In addition to it showing that it works in my fastpages, it also proves that javascript works because the program itself is coded in javascript.
