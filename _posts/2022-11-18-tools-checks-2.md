### Python Check

To show that my python code works through Jupyter Notebook by using my old Rapid API code. This program is running on fastpages and printing the output on the fastpages blog, using anaconda kernel.

The ```make server``` command starts a live server based on the fastpages being updated right away using docker containers.
