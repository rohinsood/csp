# Lesson 1
 - I recieved a 0.7/1.0
   - Although I was initially shoked, I believe that this score is ultimately reflective of my attention to detail, however, it is unfreflective of my effort and learnings. I believe I deserve a 0.9/1.0
       - When reading over the prompts, I missed a few of the tasks assigned to me and completely forgot to complete them. In my blog, however, I wrote a quick paragraph about what I learned from the lesson.
   - I can improve on this by spending more time on each assignment and paying closer attention to detail
# Lesson 2
 - I recieved a 0.95/1.0
   - I believe that this score is honestly reflective of the ideas and learnings i developed during this lesson.
     - I put in a large amount of time into answering their prompt and made sure to get to every prompt assigned unlike the last one.
   - I can improve by adding more detail to my answers and explaining why something may or may not be correct.
