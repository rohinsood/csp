I apologize for the music I was unaware that my recording software picked it up . Write-Up . Describe Procedural Abstraction, discussion on code and abstraction techniques used: Frontend/Backend, Functions, Classes, etc Procedural abstraction is a programming concept that refers to the ability to break down a complex task or process into smaller, more manageable procedures or functions. These procedures can then be used as building blocks to construct larger, more complex systems. | In frontend/backend integration, procedural abstraction is used to separate the frontend and backend code into distinct, modular components. This separation allows developers to work on each component independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues and to scale the system as needed. Both functions and classes promote procedural abstraction by allowing developers to break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable components. This avoids code duplication and maintains a modular structure Within this database, models of each NBA player are defined in a class and instances with distinct parameters of this class are created. This prevents me from having to make 790 different classes to account for the 790 different NBA players Link to the Model class | . | . | . | . | Describe Data Abstraction, discussion on data used and data structures to support project: JSON, Dictionaries, Lists, and/or Database Tables. Data abstraction is a programming concept that refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of data structures and exposing only the relevant information to the user. This allows developers to work with complex data structures without worrying about the underlying details. Data abstraction is crucial to ensure that data is stored and accessed efficiently and accurately. There are several data structures that can be used to support data abstraction, including JSON, dictionaries, lists, and database tables. | JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. JSON can be used to represent complex data structures, such as objects and arrays, in a compact and efficient manner. JSON is widely used in web applications and can be easily parsed and manipulated using JavaScript and other programming languages. A JSON is the result of a GET request from the API I set up &amp; it is abstracted within the fronted by displaying data Link to JSON usage in the timer feature | Link to JSON usage in the search feature | Link to JSON usage in the quiz feature | Link to NBA player API | . | . | Dictionaries are data structures that store key-value pairs. In Python, for example, dictionaries can be used to represent complex data structures, such as JSON objects. Dictionaries are efficient for looking up specific values based on a key, and they can be easily modified and extended. A dictionary object is converted to a JSON by a get request in my API &amp; also are nested within the list of NBA data Link to dictionary usage in API | Link to nested dictionary usage in the search feature | . | . | Lists are another common data structure that can be used to support data abstraction. Lists allow developers to store a collection of values, such as strings or numbers, and manipulate them using methods like append, remove, and sort. Lists are particularly useful for managing large collections of data. I iterate through lists of data after being parsed from its previous JSON format in all features Link to list usage in the timer feature | Link to list usage in the search feature | Link to list usage in the quiz feature | . | . | Database tables can be used to store and manage large amounts of structured data. Database tables provide a powerful and efficient way to query and retrieve data using SQL, or Structured Query Language. SQL allows developers to select, filter, and aggregate data in a way that is optimized for performance and scalability. I establish different tables for the different kinds of data that I will be storing. There is a user table, a nba_players table, a comments table | . | . | . | . | Describe Usage of Control Structures, ie Iteration and Conditional Statements. Areas where you use lists and interation in Frontend Display. Areas were you decide and execulte different paths of code, for instance Create vs Read vs Update vs Delete. Also, show a function where a different parameter or condition causes a differen result. Control structures, such as iteration and conditional statements, are essential programming concepts that allow developers to control the flow of execution in their code. Iteration, or looping, allows developers to execute a block of code repeatedly, either for a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. Conditional statements can also be combined with iteration to create more complex control structures. | I implement control structures in my frontend design throughout all features I iterate through, find, and display an NBA player in the search feature | I iterate through the list of users and display their correct/incorrect answers in the search feature | I iterate through and display the list of users in the timer feature | . | I run POST requests to create comments related to a user through use of ORM Fronted API request | Backend code implementation | . | I created a function to listen to the keys being entered into the search bar of the search feature and only ran the search function if specifically the enter key is pressed. There is no result in the event that the enter key is not pressed Link to function | . | . | .",

How does someone empower themself in a digital world? By safeguarding themselves from potential digital threats, a person can empower themselves in a digital world. This could mean securing your data by not posting it online or by securing it with the help of other services, like a virtual private network (VPN). . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Empowered individuals may be able to assist by directing or safeguarding those who are not. They could also instruct those who lack power to do so for themselves. If someone believes they are not good at what they are doing, for instance, I could teach them how to program or help them feel more confident in themselves and their programming skills. I tried my best, but I’m not sure if this was the right answer. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Yes, digital empowerment is hindered by paper and bureaucracy. When a person is unable to acquire a device or something else due to financial constraints, these barriers can be seen in financial differences. This is prevalent in Del Norte as well as elsewhere due to the global nature of the issue. . Other Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit.

Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? An internet blocker has the advantages of preventing a person from installing software that could harm their device or other devices at the school and preventing them from seeing content that is inappropriate for them to view. One of the main drawbacks is that these blockers prevent students from installing or using software or other resources they might need, especially in classes like computer science. . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. I worry about the future of the world for myself. People who have access to or the ability to purchase devices are frequently left behind, despite the fact that those who do have devices have an advantage. Those without devices may be severely disadvantaged as they increasingly become required for educational purposes and even for purchases. I’m not too concerned about myself, but those without devices have a lot of trouble, which is concerning. . . 5.3 Questions . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. Intentional or Purposeful bias: Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Virtual assistants may have female voices because women are often seen in a ‘helpful’/’caregiving’ type role, which stereotypically happens to be the role of women. However, this may not have purposeful, as simply choosing the voice that sounded the best would have been the most likely option. This can be a good business move, as it panders to customers when the developers try to choose what they believe would be the most appealing to customers. This may not be corrected, but only if this is truly the case, and the female voice was not chosen because women are seen in service positions only. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) Algorithms on websites such as Amazon are often used to influence customer purchases. For example, Amazon will often show products that are similar to what the user is buying, because they may want to buy similar items. Amazon algorithms are also used to recommend products that other people have bought along with the product you are trying to buy, for the same reason. . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify your conclusion. I think the owner of the computer may think it was intentional, as he seems surprised that it does not recognize him. . How do you think this happened? This may have happened due to oversight in the program’s coding. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? Yes, it’s harmful and it should be corrected, as it causes a divide in the ways the program can be used. It likely wasn’t intended to be harmful, however, and was likely just an oversight in the program. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? More testing and from a wider population would create a much better outcome. . 5.4 Questions . Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in your project. In my project, crowdsourcing could be used in development of recipes, as my site has a feature in which users can add recipes to the database. . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Crowdsourcing (if speaking in a general sense) could be used to take results for a survey, such as a customer service survey. This could help with improvements to the project as a whole, as information from others can help make the project better. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Del Norte crowdsourcing could definitely help with creating more recipes, and improving the site and its functionality. Although crowdsourcing isn’t necessary for the project to function, it does help a lot with creating a good number of recipes that users can access. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. Random recipe data would be interesting to see, as it would take quite a long time to actually implement a whole recipe into the program, instead of just getting portion numbers. .",

Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing. . Evidence of Crowdsourcing . Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing. It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community. Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than “official” information. | Crypto currency and associated block chain. All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners. If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again. Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency. Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records). | COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing. This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks. The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives. | . Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing (Crossover Group Up, ~10 minutes) . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. | . The first API I used was the Covid Data API. For our last project we used an API that gave us words for Hangman. We also a jokes API. Currently we are using an API to give a recipe for our suggester. . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? | . The biggest discovery I found was that you can have a website on github pages, and set up actions so that what you commit will autonomously deploy on github pages. . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20.

CompSci has 150ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Our slack channel is basically an example of crowd sourcing, as we have a large group of people who can help if we ever run into any difficulties. | What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Yes, our project would definitely improve with crowd sourcing. Because we are going to have a feature where users can add reviews on recipes, the more reviews we have will definitely make our website seem more reliable. | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. As said earlier, the more reviews we have, the more impressive and interesting our project will be. So on the day of N@TM we would be looking to get users to not only use our recipe suggester but to also leave reviews for each recipe in order to better our product. | . Computer Bias . Earlier we talked about beneficial and harmful effects of computing. Such conversation often lead to conversations on computer bias, particularly when bias creates a harmful effect. . As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms. It has been said, “Humans are error-prone and biased”. So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better? . Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes) . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? | . Older people use Facebook while the younger generation uses TikTok. Data says that more than 41% of the users on Facebook are 18-34 years. Meanwhile around 60% of users on tik tok are between the ages of 16-24. It can be slightly harmful as companies use this information and show more targeted ads. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? | . The reason virtual assistants have female voices is because that’s what people thought was more appealing and friendly back when these technologies were first developed. Some people think that it’s a bad thing because it reinforces gender stereotypes, while others think it’s fine. Companies are starting to offer different voice options, including male and gender-neutral voices, to be more inclusive. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) | . An example of an algorithm that affects decisions is the recommendation algorithm used by Netflix and Amazon to suggest personalized content or products. It analyzes user behavior to show items they’re more likely to enjoy or buy. . As Pairs (5 minutes) . Watch the video… HP computers are racist | The speaker claims that an HP media smart computer’s face tracking software is racist as it does not follow them when they move in front of the camera but does follow their white co-worker. The speaker says they bought the same computer for Christmas and hopes their wife doesn’t see the video, as the computer does not follow them and only follows their white co-worker. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Based on the video, it’s not explicitly stated if the owner of the computer thinks this was intentional or not. However, they do make a statement that they believe HP computers are racist. | How do you think this happened? This probably happened because of a lack of diversity in the testing and development process, leading to potential biases in the software. It could also be due to a lack of proper calibration or technical difficulties with the hardware. | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Yes, this can be harmful as it creates an exclusionary experience for the individual who is black and is not being properly recognized by the computer. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and discrimination. I personally don’t think it was intensional. | Should it be corrected? Yes, it should be corrected. Technology should be inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of race or ethnicity. This can be done by increasing diversity in the development and testing process, ensuring that the software is properly calibrated and tested, and by implementing measures to address and correct any biases in the technology. | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? I would test with all different types of people and make sure that it works with a diverse group of people. | . | .",

A beneficial effect of using computers is the free access to knowledge. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can communicate worldwide for work, friends, and/or family. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can back up photos and store data. | Harmful: . A harmful effect of using computers is you could get your data stolen or you could get hacked. | A harmful effect of using computers is that you could get addicted to video games or sucked into online media | A harmful effect of using computers is you could get groomed by online predators. | Dopamine Issues . Real? In my opinion, dopamine is a genuine factor and contributes to various problems, particularly among social media users. Social media attracts individuals to crave for constant engagement. Every time an individual receives a notification on their phone, they experience a rush of dopamine and excitement. For instance, receiving likes on social media posts can evoke feelings of happiness and validation for many people. . Parent Conspiracy? Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is a scientifically verified concept with real-life examples, such as the story of Anthony Rosner, showcasing its effects. . Dopamine in My Life . I realized that excessive video gaming and TikTok watching was negatively impacting my academic performance. I used to spend 2 hours a night, 10 hours a week on video games before realizing the harm it was causing. I gradually reduced my gaming until I quit completely to improve my school-life balance. Similar to video games, TikTok was also consuming a lot of my time and distracting me. So, I deleted the app for the same reason. To counter the dopamine addiction, I adopted healthier habits like reading, drawing, and doing homework during breaks. These changes helped me to overcome my dopamine dependency and improved my daily life. . 5.2 Notes . Digital Divide .

Blog Post Reflection . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Individuals can enhance their digital literacy by being proficient in basic commands. For instance, if a teacher is moving quickly during a lecture and the material is available on my computer, I can quickly capture it with the “command + shift + 3” screenshot command. Additionally, for computer science classes, if I need to record a video, I can utilize the “command + shift + 5” screen recording command. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . An individual with strong knowledge can empower others by assisting students who may have limited understanding. At DNHS, I can contribute by offering tutoring to lower grade students or those taking classes I have already completed. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Red tape, not paper, may be hindering digital empowerment. Excessive bureaucratic procedures can prolong the digital process and slow down its progress. At Del Norte, certain restrictions are blocking digital empowerment. .",

In order to fulfill the requirements that this submission failed to meet, I will make sure to discuss how I manage complexity in my program. In my feature for this week’s hacks, I managed complexity in many different ways and I think I can comprehensively explain it to make it clear to CollegeBoard why I deserve full points. I used many functions and data abstraction methods to make my code cleaner. This submission failed to meet this standard because it did not explicitly mention why certain procedures were implemented with the goal of reducing program complexity, something required by the CollegeBoard standards. .",

Reflection . There was one discrepancy between my grading and CollegeBoard’s. I gave the student the point for program purpose and function because they stated that it “provided infomration on a triangle based on inputted side lengths”. I believe that this, along with their additional commentary, did satisfy the requirements for the overall purpose of the program. In order to ensure that I satisfy this requirement, I will throughly explain the purpose of my program and all of its features. I will use technical terminology to clearly convey my knowledge of the topic. A submission may fail to meet this criteria because they fail to discuss the functionality and output of their program appropriately. They were given a 0 out of 1 because there is no partial credit. . Student 2 . Grading . Category Requirements Student Score CB Score . Program Purpose and Function | ✅ input✅ program functionality✅ output✅ describes the overall purpose of the program.✅ describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.✅ describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video. | 1 | 1 | . Data Abstraction | ✅ includes two program code segments:✅ one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type).✅ one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.✅ identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. ✅ describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. | 1 | 1 | . Managing Complexity | ✅ includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program.✅ explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. | 1 | 1 | . Procedural Abstraction | ✅ includes two program code segments: ✅ one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.✅ one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.✅ describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | 1 | 1 | . Algorithm Implementation | ✅ includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes✅ sequencing✅ selection✅ iteration✅ explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. | 1 | 1 | . Testing | ✅ describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.✅ describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure.✅ identifies the result of each call. | 1 | 1 | . Reflection . I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for the 2nd performance task submission. The student clearly meets all criteria required for a 6/6 and had the necessary code and explanations to achieve this score. In my own work, I will ensure that I create mutliple procedures with parameters to manipulate lists. Lists are a large part of the CollegeBoard APCSP requirements, so I’ll add lots of data abstraction methods using them. There is no partial credit awarded, so I will make sure to follow every single requirement exactly. The student who created this CPT did just that. .",

States what is inside said data type. List has more than 1 element. Describes what the elements in the list represent. | . Managing Complexity | 0. This doesn’t exactly manage complexity, as the gathering of different names doesn’t manage the different complex parts of the code. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. The student correctly defines a student-developed function not placed in any language specifically. Shows complete function definition and calling the function in a multiplicity of areas. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. The Student correctly demonstrates the usage of sequencing, selection and iteration throughout their program by running through multiple different function calls adn how each is selected. | . Reflection: At first I was unaware of the necessary definition of “operation” and what College Board meant by “purpose”. Seeing that the purpose earned a 0 was insightful to how I will hopefully eventually write my own performance task. . Video/Review 2 . Section Grade (1 or 0) . Program Purpose and Function | 1. Identifies the criteria the game is based upon, what the program’s inputs are (specifically) and specifically delineates what the program outputs and its functionality | . Data Abstraction | 1. Multiple lists are demonstrated to exist and their various contents are explained and the data types analyzed. This meets all the requirements to this point. | . Managing Complexity | 1. This program uses a list in order to store the binary status of every item on the grid. This being unable to be done otherwise, this correctly manages complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. Utilizes the procedure place cell and describes the function call, parameters, function, and output of the program. Correctly describes usage of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly describes the utilization of an algorithm and how the algorithm processes different inputs by using various different function calls. Then proceeds to demonstrate the logic. | . Reflection: I now see the extent to which College Boards wants a proper “purpose” to one’s program. This purpose should appropriate reflect the why, not necessarily the how. .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Decidable problems are problems where algorithms can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. In contrast, undecidable problems are problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution. | . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . this is the correct answer because a three step algorithm is an algorithm where you multiply a variable and integer, all to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Hack 3 Answer . Through use of recursion, this method sorts through the array arr and calls itself whenever the value is not found . function recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr) { let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); if (arr.length === 1 &amp;&amp; arr[0] != n) { return false; } if (n === arr[mid]) { return true; } else if (n &lt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(0, mid)); } else if (n &gt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(mid)); } } . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 4 Answer . I used the sort() function which quickly sorts through the list and prints the data in the correct order. This algorithm is much easier and faster, there aren&#39;t any while loops or if statements needed. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] # list of numbers not in order print(&quot;unsorted data:&quot;, data) # print unsorted data print (&quot;&quot;) data.sort() # sort function to sort through data print(&quot;sorted data&quot;, data) # print sorted data . unsorted data: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] sorted data [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 .

You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares).

Question 3 . { if CANMOVEFORWARD{ moveForwards } else{ if CANTURNRIGHT{ turnright } if CANTURNLEFT{ turnleft } } } . Question 4 / 5 . Explanation: To search for element 69, you would first look at the middle index, 5 (4.5, round up to 5). This is 6. As six is less than 69, you would look at the greater than half. This half&#39;s middle index is 7 (5+9 = 14/2 = 7). the seventh index is 11, which is less than 69. Then we look at the 8th index ((8+8)/2 = 8). Since 8 = 69, we have searched and found the correct number. . Question 7 . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . You could add this in this order in order to put them in alphabetical order, ascending. This way these could be properly compared, as numbers are greater, you can compare which numerical value of these ascii characters is greater. . Question 8 . Binary search is far quicker than sequential search because binary search inherently rules out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . Question 9 . Out of the list [64,36,16,11,9], I would be searching for 36. First I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and for the purpose of collegeboard that is the middle element), and 16 is less than 36, so I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/Tree2.png&quot;) display .

The correct choice would be PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }. As it matches the formula (total T/ total D). . Problem 3 . False. This would not print anything out, as it does not display anything in the body of the procedure, and when the function is called it does not display the return value. . Problem 4 . Answer 1. This is because we calculate the total footprint individually, per flight, then complete the total by adding the two. Also answer 3 as answer 3 first finds each individually, then adds the two up. . hacks section 12-13 . Problems 1/2/3 .

This will move the robot up, rotate it left. Then it moves up, rotates and moves right one extra, then the same, but to the left. Finally, it will move up one then move to the left one. Then it will move up 2 and move it right one. then it will go forwards, rotate right, then go forwards 2 through goForwardX . What is the correct name of the procedure? . A: PROCEDURE MYLIST. Technically, you can use the name MyList for a procedure, it is just that it still needs caps. using procedure in lowercase is not how collegeboard wants people to define procedures, and so PROCEDURE MYLIST (using full caps) is the best pick. . Second Robot Problem . PROCEDURE MoveForwardsUntil(direction, number){ while number != 0{ MOVE_FORWARD() if direction = right{ if not CAN_MOVE(right){ number -= 1 } } else if direction = left { if not CAN_MOVE(left){ number -= 1 } } } MOVE_FORWARD() } ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MoveForwardsUntil(right, 3) ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD . The procedure here decrements number by one every single time it passes a black block by checking whether it can move that way. That way, we can count to see how many black blocks we pass. Then the procedure makes the robot move one forward to ensure it is lined up. . Third Robot Problem . PROCEDURE FinishCourse(){ while not Goal_Completed{ if not CAN_MOVE(forward){ if CAN_MOVE(left){ ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() } else if CAN_MOVE(right) { ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() } else{ ROTATE_RIGHT() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() } } MOVE_FORWARD() } } FinishCourse() . This procedure works because it just asks the robot to move forward until it reaches an obstacle. If it does, then it check first to turn left (because in this case it is more optimal), then to turn right, at which it turns, moves up one (to dodge the obstacle) and then turns back to realign itself. This repeats until it reaches the top, at which point it turns left infinitely until it reaches the goal. . Extra: Creating and finishing my own course . Code to Complete Course . PROCEDURE TurnXDeg(times_To_turn){ for i in range(times_To_turn){ ROTATE_RIGHT() } } PROCEDURE goForwardX(X){ for i in range x { MOVE_FORWARD()) } } TurnXDeg(2) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(4) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(3) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(3) MOVE_FORWARD() TurnXDeg(1) goForward(2) . This just uses some simple compound function to repeat certain actions a certain amount of times to complete tasks. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/sugma.png&quot;) print(&quot;Course to Finish:&quot;) display(im) .

            "content": "CSP Textbook Notes . Big Idea 1: Creative Development . Computing innovations . Inspiration to create this shit is found everywhere😈😈😈 . | Constantly changing &amp; improving . | Applied in many other fields . Simulations . Cost-effective . | Easier to do large num of tests . | Con: does not account for all real-world variables . | . | Health &amp; medicine . Data analytics or smth . | . | . | . | Hardware vs software . Physical components vs virtual instructions via programming lang . | Computing innovation is about the software . | Computing hardware has gotten smaller and more powerful over the years . | Examples . Software . OS . | Driverless vehicle software . | Dual monitor programs for windows . | Compiler . | Graphics card driver . | . | Hardware . Motherboard . | Self-driving car . | Monitor . | Transistor . | Graphics card . | . | . | . | Collaboration . Helps people learn from each other . Diverse perspectives that avoid bias in computing development . For example, if the product is used by short and tall people, hiring only tall people to work on the product could bring bias; hiring both short and tall people brings new perspectives that may not have been achieved otherwise . | . | Companies hire ppl who can code and have good collaboration skills . | Effective collaboration can help one gain insight and knowledge by applying multiple perspectives, experiences, and skillsets . | . | Collaboration is a learned skill . Includes communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, &amp; negotiation . | . | Collaboration can make others more self-aware . Matches weaknesses with someone elses strengths -&gt; better product and new insight . | . | Facilitates the solving of computational problems by applying multiple perspectives and skill sets . Combines different peoples resources. Talents &amp; experiences . | . | Not limited by location . Current computational tools allow people in diff physical locations to share data &amp; info . | . | . | How programs function . Program is often referred to as software . A collection of prgram statements that perform a specific task when run byt hte computer . | Software is a set of instructions data or pgrams used to operate computers and execute specific tasks . | . | Difficult to determine if a program works for every condition . | Programmers can never have too many test cases . Logical errors demonstrate why collaboration si so important in programming . | Common that a fresh set of eyes will be better than an entrenched programmer . | . | A complex program can be described broadly by what it does . Keeping the program abstract helps the user focus on using the program instead of looking at the code . . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction, doesn’t show the user how it works . | . | . | Program Input . This is data sent to a computer for processing by a program . Can come in multiple forms: . Tactile . User interaction . | . | Audio . | Visual . | Text . | . | Example of input/output . . | User says “hey phone” - triggers an event . The action that supplies input data to a program . Key press . | Mouse click . | Program is started . | Anu other dewfinmed action taht affects the flow of execution . | . | . | . | . | . | Development process . Can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature . A development process that is iterative requires refine ment and revisions based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process, this may require revisiting earlier phases of the process . #1) investigating and reflecting ↡ . | #2 designing ↡ . | #3) prototyping ↡ . | #4) testing ↻ . | . | Example . #1) due to location restrictions, there is a large need for an effective way of communicating with a team . | #2) design the steps needed to develop the multiple algorithms that allow for certain functionalities such as video conferencing . | #3) write the program . | #4) Execute the program to find errors . | This process will be repeated until an acceptable product is reached or the programmer just runs out of time . | . | . | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem ito smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole . A program rarely works on the first development and breaking it into smaller parts of the code reduces the debugging process . | . | Once they work, add the small chunks of code together to form the bigger program . | . | The DESIGN of a program incorporates investigations to determine its reqs . Most programs are for ppl not progs and to meet the needs of ppl, investigation mus tidentify the prgram constraints &amp; the concerns and interested of people who will uise the program . | Example of perfomraing investigation . Colecting data in surveys . | User testing . | Interviews . | Direct observations . | . | Example of design phase . Brainstorming . | Planning and storyboarding . | Organizing the program into modules and function components . | Creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface . | Developing a testing strat for the program . | . | . | . | Program Documentation . A written desc of the func of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed . | Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming envs . Progs should document a program throughout its development - helps them rember what they were thinking . | . | Comments . Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs . | Do not affect run speed . | . | Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else . Should include the origin or authors name . | . | . | Program Errors . Three types of errors can occur . Logic error . Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly . | . | Syntax Error . Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed . | . | Runtime Error . Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program . | Prog langs define their own runtime errors . | . | . | . | . Big Idea 2: Data . Bits represent data . Bit . Shorthand for a single binary digit and is etierh 0 or 1 . | . | Byte . 8 bits . | 0111 0011 - contains 1 byte and 8 bits . | . | Binary sequences . Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs. . | variable length . Example . Colors . | Boolean logic . | Lists &amp; so on . | . | . | . | Some data may take many bits to represent it . For example: . 10 MP uses 10,000,000 pixels . 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits . | MP is one billion pixels . | . | This means that there are 8 bits * 6 bytes * 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture. . (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec) . | . | . | . | . | Abstractions . Bits are grouped to represent abstractions . EX: . Numbers . | Chars . | Colors . | &amp; so on . | . | . | Abstractions find common features to generalize the program . Helps to shrink code &amp; reduces the chance of error . | Example: . . | The programming language is an abstraction of machine code &amp; makes it easier to do stuff like add nums . | . | . | . | Analog vs digital data . Ananalog signal . has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals . | Ex: . Pitch . | Volume . | Colors . | Position of a sprinter during a race . | . | CONTINUOUS SIGNALS . | . | Digital signals . An analog signal that has been broken up into steps . | Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a sampling technique, . measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample . | . | . | . | . | (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction) . | Consequences of using bits to represent data . A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value . Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val . | EG: . Integer: 4 . | Real Number: 4.00 . | Boolean: True | False | . | String: “Novak the third” . | List: [1, 1, 35, 6] . | . | Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits . Limits the num range of int vals &amp; math operations on such values . | Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error . | AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer’s memory . | KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM . | . | . | . | Number Systems . Bin, decimal, &amp; hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data . | KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM . | . | . | Various Errors . Several diff types of erroos can occur: . Overflow Errors . In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits . | when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number . | EX: . On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7dec) . | Running smth like . x=7 . | Y = x++ . | . | Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw . | . | . | Run-time errors . A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run . EX: Accessing undeclared vars . | . | . | Roundoff errors . Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another . EX: ⅓ = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ⅓ 0.3333 on a diff comp . | . | . | . | . | Lossy and Lossless Data compressions . Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data . (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info) . | . | Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs . | Lossy Compression . Can significantly reduce the file size for storage and transmission . | Trade-off is that u will not recover the original file &amp; SOME data will always be lost . | Used in sitch where minimizing transmission time &amp; data size is important . | . | Lossless Compression . NO DATA IS LOST . | Trade off is larger files that can be harder to store, transfer, and handle . | Used in sitch where quality or ability to reconstruct the orig file is important . | . | . | . | Information Extracted from Data . Computer programs can be used to process info &amp; gain insight &amp; knowledge . Info can include digital data such as . Geographic data . | Premium data on social med sites based on usage . | . | . | Information . The collection of facts and patterns extracted from data . | . | Gaining insight from the above valuable involves a combination of… . Statistics . | Mathematics . | Programming . | And problem solving . | . | Large data sets may be analyzed computationally to reveal… . Patterns . | Trends . | Associations . | (can me bisinterpereted) . | (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists) . (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature) . | . | . | The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted . A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion . | Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion . | . | Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case) . | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size: . The need to clean data . Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything . | . | Incomplete data . | Invalid data . | The need to combine data sources . | . | Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications . (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools) . | EX: . Social media activity generates an enormous amount of data and uses a data processing application . | Too large to examine in hand in real-time . | . | bias is often created by the types and sources of data being collected. . not eliminated by simply collecting more data since a large amount of data collected by humans will always reflect this bias . | A large sample can magnify the bias associated with the data being used - can have little value if the sample is not representative of the population to which the results will be generalized . | . | . | . | PRedicting algorithms . Use info collected from big data to influence our daily lives . EX: . A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to extend or flag a purchase for possible fraud . | Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing habits . | . | . | . | Visualization of Data . Using appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can help one gain insight and knowledge . Data can lose their value if they cannot be presented in a way that can be interpreted . | . | Can communicate info about data &amp; make more complex data easier to interperet . Collum charts . | Line graphs . | Pie charts . | XY charts . | Radar charts . | Histograms . | waterfall charts . | EX: . this company notices that greater users =- more profit so they can spend more of their resources on advertisements and attracting more users . | . | . | . | Predicting trends is not a guarrantee of future usage . (dangeruous to solely make decisions on good data rather than all data) . | . | Use historical data to predict future events . Used to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends . This is used on current data to make predictions . | . | . | . | Privacy Concerns . Arise through mass collection of data . May contain personal info . Can affect choice in storage and transmitting . | . | . | Anything done online likely leads to the sharing of priv data . | (trade off for the convenience of online shopping is the risk of violating privacy) . | . | Metadata . data that describes data . | EX: . . | Pic of dog is data . | Filename, author, location, and time taken of this pic is metadata . | . | Used for finding, roganizing, and managing info . | Can Increase effective use of data by providing addition info ab varius aspects . | Do not change primary data . | . | . BIG IDEA 3: Algorithms and Programming . Abstraction . Way to represent essential features without including the background details or explanations . Reduce complexity . | Allow for efficient design . | &amp; implementation of complex systems . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction . | . | Math OPerators . . | . | Modulus Notes . If the dividend is a multiple of the divisor, then the return val is 0 . | If the dividend is smaller than the divisor, then the return val is the dividend itself . | If teh divisor is 0, an ERROR is thrown . | If 0 is the dividend, the return val is 0 . | . | Lists . START AT INDEX 1 . | Example of data abstraction . | . | Relational and Bool Operators . . | . | Searching . Linear search (sequential search) . Finds an element in sorted or unsorted list . Sequentially checks EVERY element in the list . | . | . | Binary Search . Finds element in a SORTED list . Halves the num of elements that need to be searched after comparing the desired val to the middle point. . If they are unequal, then the half in which the target cannot be is eliminated . | . | . | . | . | . BIG IDEA 4: Computer systems and Networks . Computing Devices . A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program . Computers . | Tabnlets . | Servers . | Routers . | Smart sensors . | . | Must be able to take inputs &gt; process such inputs &gt; calculate results based off such inputs . | Not all computing devices are computers . Non-computer computing devices can be . Calculator . | Printer . | . | . | Compuing system . Group of omcputing devices and programs working together . | Ex: a computer network . A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data . | . | . | . | Autonomous Systems of the Internet . | ** ** . This reps a computer network . Each circ is one computer system . | Larger circs have larger bandwiths . Maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time . | . | . | A path between two computing devices is a sequence of directly connected computing devices . Rounding is the process of finding a path form center to receiver . | If path is broken, then the path will be rerouted (fault tolerant nature) . | . | Internet conmnects devices and networks from all over the world . physical network of fiber optics, radio transmitters, and cabling . | Devices and networks that make up the internet are connected and communicate using standardized, open communication protocols . An agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system . | . | These protocols have allowed for the internet to be scalable and meet new demands . | . | . | Internet Protocol . Responsible for addressing and routing your online requests . | A device is first assigned an IP before connecting to the internet . | We are switching between the 4th and 6th version of the protocol (IPv4 &amp;&amp; IPv6) . IPv4 stores addresses in 32 bits, 2^32 combinations . | IPv6 stores addresses in 128 bits, 2^128 combinations . | . | NOT PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO A USER AND CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME . | . | Transmission Control Protocol . Protocol defines how computers send packets to each other. . packets . Small chunks of data that are sent to other devices on a network (including the internet) . | . | Guide the rules on how data are subdivided into small packets before transmission . | . | . | . | User Datagram Protocol . Protocol that allows computer applications to send messages without checking fro missing packets . Saves time to retransmit missing packets . | . | Not as reliable as TCP . | . | Fault Tolerance . When a system can support failures and continue to func . | The internet is designed to be fault tolerant . If one sys fails, a diff path can be chosen when routing . | . | Redunancy . Inclusion of extra paths that can mitigate the failure of a system if other components . | . | End-to-end architecture . The breaking down and assembly of packets at each end . | The middle is hidden by abstraction . | EXAMPLE: . . | There are a multitude of paths that packets can take to travel between D (sender) and k(reciever) . Since there are multiple paths, packets are likely to arrive at the receiver out of order . | . | If packets are not received, TCP will request the sender to resent the pissing packet . The IP of the send. And reciv. Are both in the header of the packet . | . | When all packets are received, then the message will be reconstructed using their order found in the header . | . | . | . | Difference between internet and world wide web . Internet refers to the hardware . Made up of computers, cables, routers, etc. . | Glo0abl decentralized network that connects millions of computers . | . | WWW refers to the software on the internet . HTTP is a protocol used by WWW to transmit data . | Internet allows access to the WWW which is a system of linked pages, programs, and files . | . | . | Efficiency of Solutions . Sequential computing . Computational model in which operations are performed in order, one at a time . Takes as long as the sum of all the steps . | . | . | Parallle Computing . Involves breaking up a task into smaller, sequential pieces . These are then executed at the same time . Each on its own processor or on a set of computers that have been networked together . | . | . | Takes AT LEAST as long as the longest branch in the prog . | . | . | Sequential Computing . Problem broken into discrete instructures . | Executed one by one by a single computing device . Having a sing CPU . | . | . | Parallel Computing . Problem broken into discrete instructions . | Executed concurrently by using multiple CPU . | Takes as long as the longest task . | Consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion . A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks + the long of its parallel tasks . | . | 2+1+4+3+1 = 11 secs tot . | . | . | Why is Parallel COmputing used? . Needed fro real world sims and modeling . Manyu things happen at the same time in the real world . | . | EX: . Weather forecasting . | Flight simulators . | Car crash modeling . | . | Speedup . Measured in the time to complete the task sequentially divided by the time to complete the task when done in parallel . SPEEDUP = (sequential run time)/(Parallel run time) . | . | Efficiency is still limited by the sequential portion . Means that, at a certain point, parallel computing will not meaningfully increase efficientcy . | . | . | Multiple processors can operate independently but share the same memory resources . ** . ** . | . | . | Distributed Computing . Computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program . Many problems are too large and complex to be solved on a single computer . Bcz of processing time or storage . | . | . | . | . | . BIG IDEA 5. Impact of Computing . The world wide web . Use of the internet and WW are changing all the time . Have forever changed how we do business and how people einteract . | . | Both positive and negative effects of the internet . | . | Digital divide . Differences in acces to technology . Including access to comps and internet . | . | Variables that affect digitale divide: . Infrastructure: some parts of the world do not have access to the internet . | Education: a person could have access to the internet but not have the education ot use it . | Indifferent: a person could have access to the internet but choose not to use it . | Cost: the cost of accessing the internet can be unafforadable . | . | Efforts are being made to reduce the digital divide . EX: . Google Project Loon uses balloons at the edge of space to provide infrastructure to to places around the world without internet access . | . | . | Ethical concern . Official government policy is being announced on the internet, . Poepl without internet acces remain in the dark . | . | . | . | Beneficial and harmful effects . Computing inncovations can have both beneifical and harmful effect on Societies, Cultures, economies . An impact, result or outcome . | . | Beneficial results are contextual and terpertive . | Identification includes both the classification of the effect as either beneficial or harmful and justification for that classification . | . | An impact beyond their intended purpose . Computing algorithms can have unintended impacts . | Internet’s original purpose was to be used exclusively by academic, government, and scientific communities. 🥶🥶🥶🥶 . | Innovations have changes way people do tasks . Teachers no longer have to hand calc grades . | . | Effects can be societal, economic, and cultural and can be connected to a group of individuals .
