For example, changing the aesthetics of our project, adding more features such as a comment area, where you could comment on the different options of teams that we had. There especially was this one parent that questioned us about the mechanics and overall code and we were able to give them a satisfactory response and they gave us a suggestion on changing the colors of our site.

A program rarely works on the first development and breaking it into smaller parts of the code reduces the debugging process . | . | Once they work, add the small chunks of code together to form the bigger program . | . | The DESIGN of a program incorporates investigations to determine its reqs . Most programs are for ppl not progs and to meet the needs of ppl, investigation mus tidentify the prgram constraints &amp; the concerns and interested of people who will uise the program . | Example of perfomraing investigation . Colecting data in surveys . | User testing . | Interviews . | Direct observations . | . | Example of design phase . Brainstorming . | Planning and storyboarding . | Organizing the program into modules and function components . | Creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface . | Developing a testing strat for the program . | . | . | . | Program Documentation . A written desc of the func of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed . | Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming envs . Progs should document a program throughout its development - helps them rember what they were thinking . | . | Comments . Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs . | Do not affect run speed . | . | Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else . Should include the origin or authors name . | . | . | Program Errors . Three types of errors can occur . Logic error . Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly . | . | Syntax Error . Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed . | . | Runtime Error . Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program . | Prog langs define their own runtime errors . | . | . | . | . Big Idea 2: Data . Bits represent data . Bit . Shorthand for a single binary digit and is etierh 0 or 1 . | . | Byte . 8 bits . | 0111 0011 - contains 1 byte and 8 bits . | . | Binary sequences . Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs. . | variable length . Example . Colors . | Boolean logic . | Lists &amp; so on . | . | . | . | Some data may take many bits to represent it . For example: . 10 MP uses 10,000,000 pixels . 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits . | MP is one billion pixels . | . | This means that there are 8 bits * 6 bytes * 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture. . (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec) . | . | . | . | . | Abstractions . Bits are grouped to represent abstractions . EX: . Numbers . | Chars . | Colors . | &amp; so on . | . | . | Abstractions find common features to generalize the program . Helps to shrink code &amp; reduces the chance of error . | Example: . . | The programming language is an abstraction of machine code &amp; makes it easier to do stuff like add nums . | . | . | . | Analog vs digital data . Ananalog signal . has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals . | Ex: . Pitch . | Volume . | Colors . | Position of a sprinter during a race . | . | CONTINUOUS SIGNALS . | . | Digital signals . An analog signal that has been broken up into steps . | Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a sampling technique, . measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample . | . | . | . | . | (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction) . | Consequences of using bits to represent data . A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value . Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val . | EG: . Integer: 4 . | Real Number: 4.00 . | Boolean: True | False | . | String: “Novak the third” . | List: [1, 1, 35, 6] . | . | Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits . Limits the num range of int vals &amp; math operations on such values . | Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error . | AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer’s memory . | KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM . | . | . | . | Number Systems . Bin, decimal, &amp; hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data . | KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM . | . | . | Various Errors . Several diff types of erroos can occur: . Overflow Errors . In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits . | when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number . | EX: . On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7dec) . | Running smth like . x=7 . | Y = x++ . | . | Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw . | . | . | Run-time errors . A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run . EX: Accessing undeclared vars . | . | . | Roundoff errors . Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another . EX: ⅓ = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ⅓ 0.3333 on a diff comp . | . | . | . | . | Lossy and Lossless Data compressions . Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data . (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info) . | . | Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs . | Lossy Compression . Can significantly reduce the file size for storage and transmission . | Trade-off is that u will not recover the original file &amp; SOME data will always be lost . | Used in sitch where minimizing transmission time &amp; data size is important . | . | Lossless Compression . NO DATA IS LOST . | Trade off is larger files that can be harder to store, transfer, and handle . | Used in sitch where quality or ability to reconstruct the orig file is important . | . | . | . | Information Extracted from Data . Computer programs can be used to process info &amp; gain insight &amp; knowledge . Info can include digital data such as . Geographic data . | Premium data on social med sites based on usage . | . | . | Information . The collection of facts and patterns extracted from data . | . | Gaining insight from the above valuable involves a combination of… . Statistics . | Mathematics . | Programming . | And problem solving . | . | Large data sets may be analyzed computationally to reveal… . Patterns . | Trends . | Associations . | (can me bisinterpereted) . | (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists) . (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature) . | . | . | The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted . A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion . | Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion . | . | Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case) . | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size: . The need to clean data . Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything . | . | Incomplete data . | Invalid data . | The need to combine data sources . | . | Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications . (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools) . | EX: . Social media activity generates an enormous amount of data and uses a data processing application . | Too large to examine in hand in real-time . | . | bias is often created by the types and sources of data being collected. . not eliminated by simply collecting more data since a large amount of data collected by humans will always reflect this bias . | A large sample can magnify the bias associated with the data being used - can have little value if the sample is not representative of the population to which the results will be generalized . | . | . | . | PRedicting algorithms . Use info collected from big data to influence our daily lives . EX: . A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to extend or flag a purchase for possible fraud . | Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing habits . | . | . | . | Visualization of Data . Using appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can help one gain insight and knowledge . Data can lose their value if they cannot be presented in a way that can be interpreted . | . | Can communicate info about data &amp; make more complex data easier to interperet . Collum charts . | Line graphs . | Pie charts . | XY charts . | Radar charts . | Histograms . | waterfall charts . | EX: . this company notices that greater users =- more profit so they can spend more of their resources on advertisements and attracting more users . | . | . | . | Predicting trends is not a guarrantee of future usage . (dangeruous to solely make decisions on good data rather than all data) . | . | Use historical data to predict future events . Used to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends . This is used on current data to make predictions . | . | . | . | Privacy Concerns . Arise through mass collection of data . May contain personal info . Can affect choice in storage and transmitting . | . | . | Anything done online likely leads to the sharing of priv data . | (trade off for the convenience of online shopping is the risk of violating privacy) . | . | Metadata . data that describes data . | EX: . . | Pic of dog is data . | Filename, author, location, and time taken of this pic is metadata . | . | Used for finding, roganizing, and managing info . | Can Increase effective use of data by providing addition info ab varius aspects . | Do not change primary data . | . | .
