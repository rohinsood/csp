Their video demonstrates this effectively. Their written response describes the overall purpose | . Data Abstraction | 1. Names the variable of a list/collection data type. States what is inside said data type. List has more than 1 element. Describes what the elements in the list represent. | . Managing Complexity | 0. This doesn’t exactly manage complexity, as the gathering of different names doesn’t manage the different complex parts of the code. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. The student correctly defines a student-developed function not placed in any language specifically. Shows complete function definition and calling the function in a multiplicity of areas. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. The Student correctly demonstrates the usage of sequencing, selection and iteration throughout their program by running through multiple different function calls adn how each is selected. | . Reflection: At first I was unaware of the necessary definition of “operation” and what College Board meant by “purpose”. Seeing that the purpose earned a 0 was insightful to how I will hopefully eventually write my own performance task. . Video/Review 2 . Section Grade (1 or 0) . Program Purpose and Function | 1. Identifies the criteria the game is based upon, what the program’s inputs are (specifically) and specifically delineates what the program outputs and its functionality | . Data Abstraction | 1. Multiple lists are demonstrated to exist and their various contents are explained and the data types analyzed. This meets all the requirements to this point. | . Managing Complexity | 1. This program uses a list in order to store the binary status of every item on the grid. This being unable to be done otherwise, this correctly manages complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. Utilizes the procedure place cell and describes the function call, parameters, function, and output of the program. Correctly describes usage of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly describes the utilization of an algorithm and how the algorithm processes different inputs by using various different function calls. Then proceeds to demonstrate the logic. | . Reflection: I now see the extent to which College Boards wants a proper “purpose” to one’s program. This purpose should appropriate reflect the why, not necessarily the how. .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Decidable problems are problems where algorithms can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. In contrast, undecidable problems are problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution. | . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . this is the correct answer because a three step algorithm is an algorithm where you multiply a variable and integer, all to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Hack 3 Answer . Through use of recursion, this method sorts through the array arr and calls itself whenever the value is not found . function recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr) { let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); if (arr.length === 1 &amp;&amp; arr[0] != n) { return false; } if (n === arr[mid]) { return true; } else if (n &lt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(0, mid)); } else if (n &gt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(mid)); } } . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 4 Answer . I used the sort() function which quickly sorts through the list and prints the data in the correct order. This algorithm is much easier and faster, there aren&#39;t any while loops or if statements needed. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] # list of numbers not in order print(&quot;unsorted data:&quot;, data) # print unsorted data print (&quot;&quot;) data.sort() # sort function to sort through data print(&quot;sorted data&quot;, data) # print sorted data . unsorted data: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] sorted data [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Hack 5 Answer . # permutations using library function from itertools import permutations # Get all permutations of [1, 2, 3] perm = permutations([1, 2, 3], 3) # the 3 outside the bracket is all the permutations of the length 3 # if we changed it to 2 it would show all the permutations of the length 3. # Print the obtained permutations for i in list(perm): print ([i]) .

Libraries consist of pre-written code that can be utilizing in other programs.

Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete.

Question 3 . { if CANMOVEFORWARD{ moveForwards } else{ if CANTURNRIGHT{ turnright } if CANTURNLEFT{ turnleft } } } . Question 4 / 5 . Explanation: To search for element 69, you would first look at the middle index, 5 (4.5, round up to 5). This is 6. As six is less than 69, you would look at the greater than half. This half&#39;s middle index is 7 (5+9 = 14/2 = 7). the seventh index is 11, which is less than 69. Then we look at the 8th index ((8+8)/2 = 8). Since 8 = 69, we have searched and found the correct number. . Question 7 . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . You could add this in this order in order to put them in alphabetical order, ascending. This way these could be properly compared, as numbers are greater, you can compare which numerical value of these ascii characters is greater. . Question 8 . Binary search is far quicker than sequential search because binary search inherently rules out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . Question 9 . Out of the list [64,36,16,11,9], I would be searching for 36. First I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and for the purpose of collegeboard that is the middle element), and 16 is less than 36, so I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/Tree2.png&quot;) display .

The correct choice would be PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }. As it matches the formula (total T/ total D). . Problem 3 . False. This would not print anything out, as it does not display anything in the body of the procedure, and when the function is called it does not display the return value. . Problem 4 . Answer 1. This is because we calculate the total footprint individually, per flight, then complete the total by adding the two.

This will move the robot up, rotate it left. Then it moves up, rotates and moves right one extra, then the same, but to the left. Finally, it will move up one then move to the left one. Then it will move up 2 and move it right one. then it will go forwards, rotate right, then go forwards 2 through goForwardX . What is the correct name of the procedure? . A: PROCEDURE MYLIST. Technically, you can use the name MyList for a procedure, it is just that it still needs caps. using procedure in lowercase is not how collegeboard wants people to define procedures, and so PROCEDURE MYLIST (using full caps) is the best pick. . Second Robot Problem . PROCEDURE MoveForwardsUntil(direction, number){ while number != 0{ MOVE_FORWARD() if direction = right{ if not CAN_MOVE(right){ number -= 1 } } else if direction = left { if not CAN_MOVE(left){ number -= 1 } } } MOVE_FORWARD() } ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MoveForwardsUntil(right, 3) ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD . The procedure here decrements number by one every single time it passes a black block by checking whether it can move that way. That way, we can count to see how many black blocks we pass. Then the procedure makes the robot move one forward to ensure it is lined up. . Third Robot Problem . PROCEDURE FinishCourse(){ while not Goal_Completed{ if not CAN_MOVE(forward){ if CAN_MOVE(left){ ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() } else if CAN_MOVE(right) { ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() } else{ ROTATE_RIGHT() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() } } MOVE_FORWARD() } } FinishCourse() . This procedure works because it just asks the robot to move forward until it reaches an obstacle. If it does, then it check first to turn left (because in this case it is more optimal), then to turn right, at which it turns, moves up one (to dodge the obstacle) and then turns back to realign itself. This repeats until it reaches the top, at which point it turns left infinitely until it reaches the goal. . Extra: Creating and finishing my own course . Code to Complete Course . PROCEDURE TurnXDeg(times_To_turn){ for i in range(times_To_turn){ ROTATE_RIGHT() } } PROCEDURE goForwardX(X){ for i in range x { MOVE_FORWARD()) } } TurnXDeg(2) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(4) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(3) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(3) MOVE_FORWARD() TurnXDeg(1) goForward(2) . This just uses some simple compound function to repeat certain actions a certain amount of times to complete tasks. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/sugma.png&quot;) print(&quot;Course to Finish:&quot;) display(im) .

            "content": "CSP Textbook Notes . Big Idea 1: Creative Development . Computing innovations . Inspiration to create this shit is found everywhere😈😈😈 . | Constantly changing &amp; improving . | Applied in many other fields . Simulations . Cost-effective . | Easier to do large num of tests . | Con: does not account for all real-world variables . | . | Health &amp; medicine . Data analytics or smth . | . | . | . | Hardware vs software . Physical components vs virtual instructions via programming lang . | Computing innovation is about the software . | Computing hardware has gotten smaller and more powerful over the years . | Examples . Software . OS . | Driverless vehicle software . | Dual monitor programs for windows . | Compiler . | Graphics card driver . | . | Hardware . Motherboard . | Self-driving car . | Monitor . | Transistor . | Graphics card . | . | . | . | Collaboration . Helps people learn from each other . Diverse perspectives that avoid bias in computing development . For example, if the product is used by short and tall people, hiring only tall people to work on the product could bring bias; hiring both short and tall people brings new perspectives that may not have been achieved otherwise . | . | Companies hire ppl who can code and have good collaboration skills . | Effective collaboration can help one gain insight and knowledge by applying multiple perspectives, experiences, and skillsets . | . | Collaboration is a learned skill . Includes communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, &amp; negotiation . | . | Collaboration can make others more self-aware . Matches weaknesses with someone elses strengths -&gt; better product and new insight . | . | Facilitates the solving of computational problems by applying multiple perspectives and skill sets . Combines different peoples resources. Talents &amp; experiences . | . | Not limited by location . Current computational tools allow people in diff physical locations to share data &amp; info . | . | . | How programs function . Program is often referred to as software . A collection of prgram statements that perform a specific task when run byt hte computer . | Software is a set of instructions data or pgrams used to operate computers and execute specific tasks . | . | Difficult to determine if a program works for every condition . | Programmers can never have too many test cases . Logical errors demonstrate why collaboration si so important in programming . | Common that a fresh set of eyes will be better than an entrenched programmer . | . | A complex program can be described broadly by what it does . Keeping the program abstract helps the user focus on using the program instead of looking at the code . . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction, doesn’t show the user how it works . | . | . | Program Input . This is data sent to a computer for processing by a program . Can come in multiple forms: . Tactile . User interaction . | . | Audio . | Visual . | Text . | . | Example of input/output . . | User says “hey phone” - triggers an event . The action that supplies input data to a program . Key press . | Mouse click . | Program is started . | Anu other dewfinmed action taht affects the flow of execution . | . | . | . | . | . | Development process . Can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature . A development process that is iterative requires refine ment and revisions based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process, this may require revisiting earlier phases of the process . #1) investigating and reflecting ↡ . | #2 designing ↡ . | #3) prototyping ↡ . | #4) testing ↻ . | . | Example . #1) due to location restrictions, there is a large need for an effective way of communicating with a team . | #2) design the steps needed to develop the multiple algorithms that allow for certain functionalities such as video conferencing . | #3) write the program . | #4) Execute the program to find errors . | This process will be repeated until an acceptable product is reached or the programmer just runs out of time . | . | . | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem ito smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole . A program rarely works on the first development and breaking it into smaller parts of the code reduces the debugging process . | . | Once they work, add the small chunks of code together to form the bigger program . | . | The DESIGN of a program incorporates investigations to determine its reqs . Most programs are for ppl not progs and to meet the needs of ppl, investigation mus tidentify the prgram constraints &amp; the concerns and interested of people who will uise the program . | Example of perfomraing investigation . Colecting data in surveys . | User testing . | Interviews . | Direct observations . | . | Example of design phase . Brainstorming . | Planning and storyboarding . | Organizing the program into modules and function components . | Creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface . | Developing a testing strat for the program . | . | . | . | Program Documentation . A written desc of the func of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed . | Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming envs . Progs should document a program throughout its development - helps them rember what they were thinking . | . | Comments . Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs . | Do not affect run speed . | . | Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else . Should include the origin or authors name . | . | . | Program Errors . Three types of errors can occur . Logic error . Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly . | . | Syntax Error . Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed . | . | Runtime Error . Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program . | Prog langs define their own runtime errors . | . | . | . | . Big Idea 2: Data . Bits represent data . Bit . Shorthand for a single binary digit and is etierh 0 or 1 . | . | Byte . 8 bits . | 0111 0011 - contains 1 byte and 8 bits . | . | Binary sequences . Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs. . | variable length . Example . Colors . | Boolean logic . | Lists &amp; so on . | . | . | . | Some data may take many bits to represent it . For example: . 10 MP uses 10,000,000 pixels . 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits . | MP is one billion pixels . | . | This means that there are 8 bits * 6 bytes * 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture. . (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec) . | . | . | . | . | Abstractions . Bits are grouped to represent abstractions . EX: . Numbers . | Chars . | Colors . | &amp; so on . | . | . | Abstractions find common features to generalize the program . Helps to shrink code &amp; reduces the chance of error . | Example: . . | The programming language is an abstraction of machine code &amp; makes it easier to do stuff like add nums . | . | . | . | Analog vs digital data . Ananalog signal . has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals . | Ex: . Pitch . | Volume . | Colors . | Position of a sprinter during a race . | . | CONTINUOUS SIGNALS . | . | Digital signals . An analog signal that has been broken up into steps . | Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a sampling technique, . measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample . | . | . | . | . | (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction) . | Consequences of using bits to represent data . A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value . Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val . | EG: . Integer: 4 . | Real Number: 4.00 . | Boolean: True | False | . | String: “Novak the third” . | List: [1, 1, 35, 6] . | . | Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits . Limits the num range of int vals &amp; math operations on such values . | Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error . | AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer’s memory . | KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM . | . | . | . | Number Systems . Bin, decimal, &amp; hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data . | KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM . | . | . | Various Errors . Several diff types of erroos can occur: . Overflow Errors . In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits . | when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number . | EX: . On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7dec) . | Running smth like . x=7 . | Y = x++ . | . | Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw . | . | . | Run-time errors . A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run . EX: Accessing undeclared vars . | . | . | Roundoff errors . Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another . EX: ⅓ = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ⅓ 0.3333 on a diff comp . | . | . | . | . | Lossy and Lossless Data compressions . Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data . (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info) . | . | Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs . | Lossy Compression . Can significantly reduce the file size for storage and transmission . | Trade-off is that u will not recover the original file &amp; SOME data will always be lost . | Used in sitch where minimizing transmission time &amp; data size is important . | . | Lossless Compression . NO DATA IS LOST . | Trade off is larger files that can be harder to store, transfer, and handle . | Used in sitch where quality or ability to reconstruct the orig file is important . | . | . | . | Information Extracted from Data . Computer programs can be used to process info &amp; gain insight &amp; knowledge . Info can include digital data such as . Geographic data . | Premium data on social med sites based on usage . | . | . | Information . The collection of facts and patterns extracted from data . | . | Gaining insight from the above valuable involves a combination of… . Statistics . | Mathematics . | Programming . | And problem solving . | . | Large data sets may be analyzed computationally to reveal… . Patterns . | Trends . | Associations . | (can me bisinterpereted) . | (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists) . (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature) . | . | . | The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted . A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion . | Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion . | . | Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case) . | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size: . The need to clean data . Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything . | . | Incomplete data . | Invalid data . | The need to combine data sources . | . | Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications . (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools) . | EX: . Social media activity generates an enormous amount of data and uses a data processing application . | Too large to examine in hand in real-time . | . | bias is often created by the types and sources of data being collected. . not eliminated by simply collecting more data since a large amount of data collected by humans will always reflect this bias . | A large sample can magnify the bias associated with the data being used - can have little value if the sample is not representative of the population to which the results will be generalized . | . | . | . | PRedicting algorithms . Use info collected from big data to influence our daily lives . EX: . A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to extend or flag a purchase for possible fraud . | Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing habits . | . | . | . | Visualization of Data . Using appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can help one gain insight and knowledge . Data can lose their value if they cannot be presented in a way that can be interpreted . | . | Can communicate info about data &amp; make more complex data easier to interperet . Collum charts . | Line graphs . | Pie charts . | XY charts . | Radar charts . | Histograms . | waterfall charts . | EX: . this company notices that greater users =- more profit so they can spend more of their resources on advertisements and attracting more users . | . | . | . | Predicting trends is not a guarrantee of future usage . (dangeruous to solely make decisions on good data rather than all data) . | . | Use historical data to predict future events . Used to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends . This is used on current data to make predictions . | . | . | . | Privacy Concerns . Arise through mass collection of data . May contain personal info . Can affect choice in storage and transmitting . | . | . | Anything done online likely leads to the sharing of priv data . | (trade off for the convenience of online shopping is the risk of violating privacy) . | . | Metadata . data that describes data . | EX: . . | Pic of dog is data . | Filename, author, location, and time taken of this pic is metadata . | . | Used for finding, roganizing, and managing info . | Can Increase effective use of data by providing addition info ab varius aspects . | Do not change primary data . | . | .

Reduce complexity . | Allow for efficient design . | &amp; implementation of complex systems . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction . | . | Math OPerators . . | . | Modulus Notes . If the dividend is a multiple of the divisor, then the return val is 0 . | If the dividend is smaller than the divisor, then the return val is the dividend itself . | If teh divisor is 0, an ERROR is thrown . | If 0 is the dividend, the return val is 0 . | . | Lists . START AT INDEX 1 . | Example of data abstraction . | . | Relational and Bool Operators . . | . | Searching . Linear search (sequential search) . Finds an element in sorted or unsorted list .

Inclusion of extra paths that can mitigate the failure of a system if other components . | . | End-to-end architecture . The breaking down and assembly of packets at each end . | The middle is hidden by abstraction . | EXAMPLE: . . | There are a multitude of paths that packets can take to travel between D (sender) and k(reciever) . Since there are multiple paths, packets are likely to arrive at the receiver out of order . | . | If packets are not received, TCP will request the sender to resent the pissing packet . The IP of the send. And reciv. Are both in the header of the packet . | . | When all packets are received, then the message will be reconstructed using their order found in the header . | . | . | . | Difference between internet and world wide web .

Needed fro real world sims and modeling . Manyu things happen at the same time in the real world . | . | EX: . Weather forecasting . | Flight simulators . | Car crash modeling . | . | Speedup . Measured in the time to complete the task sequentially divided by the time to complete the task when done in parallel . SPEEDUP = (sequential run time)/(Parallel run time) . | . | Efficiency is still limited by the sequential portion . Means that, at a certain point, parallel computing will not meaningfully increase efficientcy . | . | . | Multiple processors can operate independently but share the same memory resources . ** . ** . | . | . | Distributed Computing .
