A unique set of numbers that identifies a device (computer/phone) on the internet/network and allows the device to send and recieve information to another device on the same internet/network. | . 2. What is a TCP port? . It&#39;s like a numbered gateway that allows data to flow in and out of a device over a network. Each port is identified with a unique # between 0 and 65535, and specific applications/services are associated with specific port #s. Ex. web traffic sent over port 80 or 443, email traffic uses port 25 or 587 | An easy way to think about it is that it is like a road that allows your car know where to go. | Purpose: By using different port numbers, multiple services/applications can run at the same time on the same device without interfering with each other&#39;s network traffic. | . Slide Hacks . 1. What does DNS stand for? . Domain Name Service . 2. What is the purpose of DNS? . Its purpose is to assign an IP address to each domain name. Its purpose is to act like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites and other online resources by their familiar names rather than obscure numerical IP addresses. . 3. How does DNS work? . When you type a domain name like www.googledocs.com into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with that domain name. The DNS server then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name in its database, and sends it back to your computer. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the server hosting the website you requested. . 4. What is a DNS resolver? . It is a computer program or service that helps your device find the IP address associated with a domain name you want to access on the internet. When you type in a domain name in your web browser, the DNS resolver translates that name into a corresponding IP address so that your device can connect to the appropriate server and display the website or other online resource you requested. . with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s: s.connect((ip, 80)) # Send a GET request to &quot;/&quot; s.sendall(b&quot;GET / HTTP/1.1 r n r n&quot;) # Recieve &amp; print 2048 bytes of data data = s.recv(2048) print(data.decode()) .

Research 1 HTTP header and describe, in detail, its purpose. . HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. When a client sends a request to a server, it includes an HTTP header, which contains additional info ab request/client. . &quot;Content-Type&quot; header - The purpose of this header is to provide information to the server about the type of data that is being sent in the body of the HTTP request or response. . Ex. if a client sends a POST request to a server with a JSON payload in the body, the Content-Type header would be set to &quot;application/json&quot;. This tells the server that the body of the request contains JSON data and helps the server understand how to parse and process the data. Similarly, when a server sends a response back to the client, it includes a Content-Type header that specifies the type of data being sent. This is important because the client needs to know how to interpret the data. . 2. Write a line in a sample NGINX configuration that will add that specific header to the `/information` location . location /information { add_header X-Custom-Header my-header-value; #other configuration directives } . 3. Explain the purpose of the load balancing performed by NGINX . The purpose of load balancing performed by NGINX is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances. This helps make websites faster and more reliable by dividing incoming traffic across multiple servers or computers, preventing one server from getting too much traffic and slowing down the website. . 4. Modify the following code block to obtain the value of the secret header on `/products` of the AWS site ✅ . aws = &quot;3.130.255.192&quot; response = requests.get(&quot;http://&quot; + aws+ &quot;/products&quot;) print(&quot;The secret header is:&quot;, &quot;&#39;X-Cooler-Header&#39;: &#39;This is my secret header!&#39;&quot;) .

Complete the above check-in questions and change the hosts ✅ | Complete the above code-segment to retrieve the secret header ✅ | . Bonus (0.05) . Create a diagram showing the layers of abstraction that allow us to use HTTP (IP, TCP, etc.) . CORS Hacks &#9989; . 1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for . CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It&#39;s a security feature used by web browsers that prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original page. If a website wants to make a request to a different domain, the domain that is being accessed must explicitly allow it by sending special headers in the response. CORS allows for controlled access to web resources that would otherwise be restricted. . 2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites To implement CORS in your website, you need to configure your server to include specific headers in the response that indicate which origins are allowed to access your resources. The most important header is the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which specifies the domain(s) that are allowed to make requests to your server. You can also use other headers to allow specific HTTP methods or headers. . 3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites . You would want to implement CORS in your own website if you need to make requests to a different domain to access resources like APIs or to embed content from other websites. . 4. How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future? . If you plan on developing websites that need to interact with resources on other domains (such as APIs or embedded content), implementing CORS can help you avoid security issues and access those resources safely. It can also help you provide a better user experience by allowing your website to communicate with other websites and services seamlessly. . KASM Hacks &#9989; . 1. What is the purpose of &quot;sudo&quot; when running commands in terminal? . The &quot;sudo&quot; command stands for &quot;superuser do&quot; and it allows users to run commands with administrative privileges in the terminal. When a command is run with sudo, it temporarily grants the user administrative access, giving them the ability to perform tasks that require special permissions, such as installing software or modifying system files. . 2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as? . Some commands to look at how a machine&#39;s storage is set up include &quot;df&quot; to see the amount of disk space avaliable on the file system, &quot;du&quot; to estimate file space usage, and &quot;mount&quot; to see what file systems are currently being used. . 3. What do you think are some alternatives to running &quot;curl -O&quot; to get the zip file for KASM? . A web browser, a download manager app, or a different command-line tool like &quot;wget&quot;. . 4. What kind of commands do you think the &quot;install.sh&quot; command has and why is it necessary to call it? . &quot;install.sh&quot; is a command that installs and configures the KASM software on your computer. It is necessary because it contains the necessary commands to install software or packages and automates the installation process, making it easier and more efficient for users. . 5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide. . To deploy KASM, a container-based streaming service, various elements such as headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS are essential. Headers are significant to configure security settings and enable CORS for KASM, while NGINX functions as a reverse proxy to manage incoming web traffic. Load balancing is necessary to distribute traffic equally among several server instances running KASM. Configuration is required to configure the KASM service and determine the specific environment settings. Finally, DNS is used to map the KASM domain name to its IP address, so users can access the service through a web browser. .",

Example of analyzing data using both NumPy and Pandas libraries . import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Load CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Filter the DataFrame to only include stats for the specified player player_name = input(&quot;Enter player name: &quot;) player_stats = df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] if player_stats.empty: print(&quot;No stats found for that player.&quot;) else: # Convert the player stats to a NumPy array player_stats_np = np.array(player_stats[[&#39;PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;, &#39;P+R+A&#39;]]) # Calculate the average of each statistic for the player player_stats_avg = np.mean(player_stats_np, axis=0) # Print out the average statistics for the player print(f&quot; nAverage stats for {player_name}:&quot;) print(f&quot;PPG: {player_stats_avg[0]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;RPG: {player_stats_avg[1]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;APG: {player_stats_avg[2]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;P+R+A: {player_stats_avg[3]:.2f}&quot;) . NumPy impacts the given code because it performs operations on arrays efficiently. Specifically, it converts a Pandas DataFrame object to a NumPy array object, and then calculates the average statistics for a the player you guys inputted. Without NumPy, it would be more difficult and less efficient to perform these calculations on large data sets. It does the math for us. . Importing data into NumPy and Pandas Performing basic data analysis tasks such as mean, median, and standard deviation Visualization of data using Matplotlib library . Matplotlib is used essentially to create visuals of data. charts,diagrams,etc. . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame print(df.head()) # Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;Points&#39; column mean_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].mean() median_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].median() stddev_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].std() # Print the results print(&#39;Mean Minutes: &#39;, mean_minutes) print(&#39;Median Minutes: &#39;, median_minutes) print(&#39;Standard Deviation Minutes: &#39;, stddev_minutes) # Create a histogram of the &#39;Points&#39; column using Matplotlib plt.hist(df[&#39;MPG&#39;], bins=20) plt.title(&#39;MPG Histogram&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;MPG&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Frequency&#39;) plt.show() . In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

I apologize for the music I was unaware that my recording software picked it up . Write-Up . Describe Procedural Abstraction, discussion on code and abstraction techniques used: Frontend/Backend, Functions, Classes, etc Procedural abstraction is a programming concept that refers to the ability to break down a complex task or process into smaller, more manageable procedures or functions. These procedures can then be used as building blocks to construct larger, more complex systems. | In frontend/backend integration, procedural abstraction is used to separate the frontend and backend code into distinct, modular components. This separation allows developers to work on each component independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues and to scale the system as needed. Both functions and classes promote procedural abstraction by allowing developers to break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable components. This avoids code duplication and maintains a modular structure Within this database, models of each NBA player are defined in a class and instances with distinct parameters of this class are created.

Data abstraction is a programming concept that refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of data structures and exposing only the relevant information to the user. This allows developers to work with complex data structures without worrying about the underlying details. Data abstraction is crucial to ensure that data is stored and accessed efficiently and accurately. There are several data structures that can be used to support data abstraction, including JSON, dictionaries, lists, and database tables. | JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. JSON can be used to represent complex data structures, such as objects and arrays, in a compact and efficient manner. JSON is widely used in web applications and can be easily parsed and manipulated using JavaScript and other programming languages. A JSON is the result of a GET request from the API I set up &amp; it is abstracted within the fronted by displaying data Link to JSON usage in the timer feature | Link to JSON usage in the search feature | Link to JSON usage in the quiz feature | Link to NBA player API | . | . | Dictionaries are data structures that store key-value pairs. In Python, for example, dictionaries can be used to represent complex data structures, such as JSON objects. Dictionaries are efficient for looking up specific values based on a key, and they can be easily modified and extended. A dictionary object is converted to a JSON by a get request in my API &amp; also are nested within the list of NBA data Link to dictionary usage in API | Link to nested dictionary usage in the search feature | . | . | Lists are another common data structure that can be used to support data abstraction. Lists allow developers to store a collection of values, such as strings or numbers, and manipulate them using methods like append, remove, and sort. Lists are particularly useful for managing large collections of data. I iterate through lists of data after being parsed from its previous JSON format in all features Link to list usage in the timer feature | Link to list usage in the search feature | Link to list usage in the quiz feature | . | . | Database tables can be used to store and manage large amounts of structured data. Database tables provide a powerful and efficient way to query and retrieve data using SQL, or Structured Query Language. SQL allows developers to select, filter, and aggregate data in a way that is optimized for performance and scalability. I establish different tables for the different kinds of data that I will be storing. There is a user table, a nba_players table, a comments table | . | . | . | . | Describe Usage of Control Structures, ie Iteration and Conditional Statements. Areas where you use lists and interation in Frontend Display. Areas were you decide and execulte different paths of code, for instance Create vs Read vs Update vs Delete. Also, show a function where a different parameter or condition causes a differen result. Control structures, such as iteration and conditional statements, are essential programming concepts that allow developers to control the flow of execution in their code. Iteration, or looping, allows developers to execute a block of code repeatedly, either for a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. Conditional statements can also be combined with iteration to create more complex control structures. | I implement control structures in my frontend design throughout all features I iterate through, find, and display an NBA player in the search feature | I iterate through the list of users and display their correct/incorrect answers in the search feature | I iterate through and display the list of users in the timer feature | . | I run POST requests to create comments related to a user through use of ORM Fronted API request | Backend code implementation | . | I created a function to listen to the keys being entered into the search bar of the search feature and only ran the search function if specifically the enter key is pressed.

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # Only unique numbers are printed # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # They only contain unique values # . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

This program had a exercise tracker, exercise goals, a forum for people to share their goals and ideas, a fitness calendar, and fitness stats based on a per person basis. The entire goal of this program is to track a person’s fitness and help them reach their personal goals, as well as share with others their goals and achievements. All features are connected to an API hosted on AWS, where all of the data that the user inputs is sent and stored for future use when the page is reloaded. . Triple AJ Arcade . This program included a ping pong game, a reaction time game, a snake game, a game called hi-lo, where the user guesses a number, and a leaderboard for all of these games. The goal of this program was to create a place where people could have fun and be competitive with their friends. The program uses lists to store data in the API through networking between the Github Pages and the Flask API database. . Project Snake . This program had a snake game and a checkers game where people could play the games and could store their scores based on their user ids. The program used lists to store the data in the Flask API using networking between the API and Github Pages. . Project NASH . This program is an arcade game, which includes a snake game, wordle, a color game where you look for the slightly different colored square, and a trivia game. All of these games have their scores managed by Flask API, where the data is stored and called whenever it is needed. The data is stored in lists in a .db file. . Ceramics .

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Although it does not significantly affect me personally, there are numerous instances in which people, particularly adolescents, are harmed by the internet as a result of negative remarks about them or their appearance. . 5.2 Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? By safeguarding themselves from potential digital threats, a person can empower themselves in a digital world. This could mean securing your data by not posting it online or by securing it with the help of other services, like a virtual private network (VPN). . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Empowered individuals may be able to assist by directing or safeguarding those who are not. They could also instruct those who lack power to do so for themselves. If someone believes they are not good at what they are doing, for instance, I could teach them how to program or help them feel more confident in themselves and their programming skills. I tried my best, but I’m not sure if this was the right answer. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Yes, digital empowerment is hindered by paper and bureaucracy. When a person is unable to acquire a device or something else due to financial constraints, these barriers can be seen in financial differences. This is prevalent in Del Norte as well as elsewhere due to the global nature of the issue. . Other Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit. My project makes it easier to find recipes, figure out the proportions, and add new recipes. . Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. My project’s potential to make users dependent on it for recipe information could be detrimental. I’m not entirely certain if there are any drawbacks). . Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? An internet blocker has the advantages of preventing a person from installing software that could harm their device or other devices at the school and preventing them from seeing content that is inappropriate for them to view. One of the main drawbacks is that these blockers prevent students from installing or using software or other resources they might need, especially in classes like computer science. . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. I worry about the future of the world for myself. People who have access to or the ability to purchase devices are frequently left behind, despite the fact that those who do have devices have an advantage. Those without devices may be severely disadvantaged as they increasingly become required for educational purposes and even for purchases. I’m not too concerned about myself, but those without devices have a lot of trouble, which is concerning. . . 5.3 Questions . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. Intentional or Purposeful bias: Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Virtual assistants may have female voices because women are often seen in a ‘helpful’/’caregiving’ type role, which stereotypically happens to be the role of women. However, this may not have purposeful, as simply choosing the voice that sounded the best would have been the most likely option. This can be a good business move, as it panders to customers when the developers try to choose what they believe would be the most appealing to customers. This may not be corrected, but only if this is truly the case, and the female voice was not chosen because women are seen in service positions only. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) Algorithms on websites such as Amazon are often used to influence customer purchases. For example, Amazon will often show products that are similar to what the user is buying, because they may want to buy similar items. Amazon algorithms are also used to recommend products that other people have bought along with the product you are trying to buy, for the same reason. . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify your conclusion. I think the owner of the computer may think it was intentional, as he seems surprised that it does not recognize him. . How do you think this happened? This may have happened due to oversight in the program’s coding. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? Yes, it’s harmful and it should be corrected, as it causes a divide in the ways the program can be used. It likely wasn’t intended to be harmful, however, and was likely just an oversight in the program. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? More testing and from a wider population would create a much better outcome. . 5.4 Questions . Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in your project. In my project, crowdsourcing could be used in development of recipes, as my site has a feature in which users can add recipes to the database. . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Crowdsourcing (if speaking in a general sense) could be used to take results for a survey, such as a customer service survey. This could help with improvements to the project as a whole, as information from others can help make the project better. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Del Norte crowdsourcing could definitely help with creating more recipes, and improving the site and its functionality. Although crowdsourcing isn’t necessary for the project to function, it does help a lot with creating a good number of recipes that users can access. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. Random recipe data would be interesting to see, as it would take quite a long time to actually implement a whole recipe into the program, instead of just getting portion numbers. .",

Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing. . Evidence of Crowdsourcing . Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing. It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community. Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than “official” information. | Crypto currency and associated block chain. All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners. If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again. Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency. Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records). | COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing. This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks. The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives. | . Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing (Crossover Group Up, ~10 minutes) . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. | . The first API I used was the Covid Data API. For our last project we used an API that gave us words for Hangman. We also a jokes API. Currently we are using an API to give a recipe for our suggester. . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? | . The biggest discovery I found was that you can have a website on github pages, and set up actions so that what you commit will autonomously deploy on github pages. . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20.

CompSci has 150ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Our slack channel is basically an example of crowd sourcing, as we have a large group of people who can help if we ever run into any difficulties. | What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Yes, our project would definitely improve with crowd sourcing. Because we are going to have a feature where users can add reviews on recipes, the more reviews we have will definitely make our website seem more reliable. | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. As said earlier, the more reviews we have, the more impressive and interesting our project will be. So on the day of N@TM we would be looking to get users to not only use our recipe suggester but to also leave reviews for each recipe in order to better our product. | . Computer Bias . Earlier we talked about beneficial and harmful effects of computing. Such conversation often lead to conversations on computer bias, particularly when bias creates a harmful effect. . As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms. It has been said, “Humans are error-prone and biased”. So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better? . Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes) . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? | . Older people use Facebook while the younger generation uses TikTok. Data says that more than 41% of the users on Facebook are 18-34 years. Meanwhile around 60% of users on tik tok are between the ages of 16-24. It can be slightly harmful as companies use this information and show more targeted ads. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? | . The reason virtual assistants have female voices is because that’s what people thought was more appealing and friendly back when these technologies were first developed. Some people think that it’s a bad thing because it reinforces gender stereotypes, while others think it’s fine. Companies are starting to offer different voice options, including male and gender-neutral voices, to be more inclusive. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) | . An example of an algorithm that affects decisions is the recommendation algorithm used by Netflix and Amazon to suggest personalized content or products. It analyzes user behavior to show items they’re more likely to enjoy or buy. . As Pairs (5 minutes) . Watch the video… HP computers are racist | The speaker claims that an HP media smart computer’s face tracking software is racist as it does not follow them when they move in front of the camera but does follow their white co-worker. The speaker says they bought the same computer for Christmas and hopes their wife doesn’t see the video, as the computer does not follow them and only follows their white co-worker. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Based on the video, it’s not explicitly stated if the owner of the computer thinks this was intentional or not. However, they do make a statement that they believe HP computers are racist. | How do you think this happened? This probably happened because of a lack of diversity in the testing and development process, leading to potential biases in the software. It could also be due to a lack of proper calibration or technical difficulties with the hardware. | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Yes, this can be harmful as it creates an exclusionary experience for the individual who is black and is not being properly recognized by the computer. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and discrimination. I personally don’t think it was intensional. | Should it be corrected? Yes, it should be corrected. Technology should be inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of race or ethnicity. This can be done by increasing diversity in the development and testing process, ensuring that the software is properly calibrated and tested, and by implementing measures to address and correct any biases in the technology. | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? I would test with all different types of people and make sure that it works with a diverse group of people. | . | .",

UAVs/Drones are used for many different things (search &amp; rescue, aerial photography, + hobbies). However, collegeboard wants to know what do people think about drones? | Automated telephone trees helped save employers money and reduce hold time for customers. College board wants to know: What innovations would you like to see in a phone tree? Will this phone tree transfer you to relevant department during office hours? Will it always enable you the opportunity for human response? | . Highlights . Affects of OpenAI + ChatGPT: . Affects google, some people wonder if ChatGPT is going to replace google | ChatGPT is able to assist with coding suggestions and debugging (practically a github copilot) | Changes the revenue of Google because of a shift from the use of Google to ChatGPT (platform shift) | Dopamine affects many people, it also is shown to be produced when people play video games or use social media. Anthony Rosner lost two years of his life due to video games | He was a top player in World of Warcraft (an online game), he played for 18 hours each day for 2 years and lost his real life to this game. He neglected his schoolwork, relationships, health, + his hygiene. | However, Rosner eventually pulled away from the reality world and started doing more productive things such as: joining a gym, DJing at his college, + becoming more socially active. | Rosner created his own film documentary called IRL (In Real Life) which highlights how he broke his gaming habit. | . | . Big Post Reflection . Three Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing . Beneficial: . A beneficial effect of using computers is the free access to knowledge. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can communicate worldwide for work, friends, and/or family. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can back up photos and store data. | Harmful: . A harmful effect of using computers is you could get your data stolen or you could get hacked. | A harmful effect of using computers is that you could get addicted to video games or sucked into online media | A harmful effect of using computers is you could get groomed by online predators. | Dopamine Issues . Real? In my opinion, dopamine is a genuine factor and contributes to various problems, particularly among social media users. Social media attracts individuals to crave for constant engagement. Every time an individual receives a notification on their phone, they experience a rush of dopamine and excitement. For instance, receiving likes on social media posts can evoke feelings of happiness and validation for many people. . Parent Conspiracy? Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is a scientifically verified concept with real-life examples, such as the story of Anthony Rosner, showcasing its effects. . Dopamine in My Life . I realized that excessive video gaming and TikTok watching was negatively impacting my academic performance. I used to spend 2 hours a night, 10 hours a week on video games before realizing the harm it was causing. I gradually reduced my gaming until I quit completely to improve my school-life balance. Similar to video games, TikTok was also consuming a lot of my time and distracting me. So, I deleted the app for the same reason. To counter the dopamine addiction, I adopted healthier habits like reading, drawing, and doing homework during breaks. These changes helped me to overcome my dopamine dependency and improved my daily life. . 5.2 Notes . Digital Divide . Digital divide is the divide between to those who can access computers and those who cannot. . Poorer/rural areas in America may not have less or little access to technology | Some countries may have different or restricted access | . Things that contribute to the Digital Divide . older computers or older technology in general may not have access to the latest updates | regional distinction | school blocked sites and restrictions | . Blog Post Reflection . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Individuals can enhance their digital literacy by being proficient in basic commands. For instance, if a teacher is moving quickly during a lecture and the material is available on my computer, I can quickly capture it with the “command + shift + 3” screenshot command. Additionally, for computer science classes, if I need to record a video, I can utilize the “command + shift + 5” screen recording command. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . An individual with strong knowledge can empower others by assisting students who may have limited understanding. At DNHS, I can contribute by offering tutoring to lower grade students or those taking classes I have already completed. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Red tape, not paper, may be hindering digital empowerment. Excessive bureaucratic procedures can prolong the digital process and slow down its progress. At Del Norte, certain restrictions are blocking digital empowerment. .",

I think that, along with their extra explanation, met the requirements for the overall goal of the program. To make sure I understand this requirement, I will clearly explain what my program does and all of its parts. I will use special words to show my knowledge about the topic. A student’s work may not meet this requirement if they don’t explain how their program works and what it gives as an output. They got a 0 out of 1 because there is no half credit. . Student 2 .

Reflection . There were no major discrepancies between my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring of the student’s work as it was scored objectively according to the rubric. In order for my program to fulfill all the requirements, specifically for Program Purpose and Function (which this student lacked), I will ensure that I describe the overall purpose of my program in a clear and concise manner, properly describe and showcase its functionality in my video, and highlight the inputs and outputs within the program. This specific submission recieved a 0 in this category because it failed to meet these criteria—its description of the program was very barebones and did not warrant a score of 1/1. . Student 4 .

Reflection . I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for the 2nd performance task submission. In order to fulfill the requirements that this submission failed to meet, I will make sure to discuss how I manage complexity in my program. In my feature for this week’s hacks, I managed complexity in many different ways and I think I can comprehensively explain it to make it clear to CollegeBoard why I deserve full points. I used many functions and data abstraction methods to make my code cleaner. This submission failed to meet this standard because it did not explicitly mention why certain procedures were implemented with the goal of reducing program complexity, something required by the CollegeBoard standards. .",

Their video demonstrates this effectively. Their written response describes the overall purpose | . Data Abstraction | 1. Names the variable of a list/collection data type. States what is inside said data type. List has more than 1 element. Describes what the elements in the list represent. | . Managing Complexity | 0. This doesn’t exactly manage complexity, as the gathering of different names doesn’t manage the different complex parts of the code. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. The student correctly defines a student-developed function not placed in any language specifically. Shows complete function definition and calling the function in a multiplicity of areas. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. The Student correctly demonstrates the usage of sequencing, selection and iteration throughout their program by running through multiple different function calls adn how each is selected. | . Reflection: At first I was unaware of the necessary definition of “operation” and what College Board meant by “purpose”. Seeing that the purpose earned a 0 was insightful to how I will hopefully eventually write my own performance task. . Video/Review 2 . Section Grade (1 or 0) . Program Purpose and Function | 1. Identifies the criteria the game is based upon, what the program’s inputs are (specifically) and specifically delineates what the program outputs and its functionality | . Data Abstraction | 1. Multiple lists are demonstrated to exist and their various contents are explained and the data types analyzed. This meets all the requirements to this point. | . Managing Complexity | 1. This program uses a list in order to store the binary status of every item on the grid. This being unable to be done otherwise, this correctly manages complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1. Utilizes the procedure place cell and describes the function call, parameters, function, and output of the program. Correctly describes usage of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1. Correctly describes the utilization of an algorithm and how the algorithm processes different inputs by using various different function calls. Then proceeds to demonstrate the logic. | . Reflection: I now see the extent to which College Boards wants a proper “purpose” to one’s program. This purpose should appropriate reflect the why, not necessarily the how. .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Decidable problems are problems where algorithms can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. In contrast, undecidable problems are problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution. | . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . this is the correct answer because a three step algorithm is an algorithm where you multiply a variable and integer, all to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Hack 3 Answer . Through use of recursion, this method sorts through the array arr and calls itself whenever the value is not found . function recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr) { let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); if (arr.length === 1 &amp;&amp; arr[0] != n) { return false; } if (n === arr[mid]) { return true; } else if (n &lt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(0, mid)); } else if (n &gt; arr[mid]) { return recursiveBinarySearch(n, arr.slice(mid)); } } . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 4 Answer . I used the sort() function which quickly sorts through the list and prints the data in the correct order. This algorithm is much easier and faster, there aren&#39;t any while loops or if statements needed. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] # list of numbers not in order print(&quot;unsorted data:&quot;, data) # print unsorted data print (&quot;&quot;) data.sort() # sort function to sort through data print(&quot;sorted data&quot;, data) # print sorted data . unsorted data: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] sorted data [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Hack 5 Answer . # permutations using library function from itertools import permutations # Get all permutations of [1, 2, 3] perm = permutations([1, 2, 3], 3) # the 3 outside the bracket is all the permutations of the length 3 # if we changed it to 2 it would show all the permutations of the length 3. # Print the obtained permutations for i in list(perm): print ([i]) .

Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points.

Question 3 . { if CANMOVEFORWARD{ moveForwards } else{ if CANTURNRIGHT{ turnright } if CANTURNLEFT{ turnleft } } } . Question 4 / 5 . Explanation: To search for element 69, you would first look at the middle index, 5 (4.5, round up to 5). This is 6. As six is less than 69, you would look at the greater than half. This half&#39;s middle index is 7 (5+9 = 14/2 = 7). the seventh index is 11, which is less than 69. Then we look at the 8th index ((8+8)/2 = 8). Since 8 = 69, we have searched and found the correct number. . Question 7 . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . You could add this in this order in order to put them in alphabetical order, ascending. This way these could be properly compared, as numbers are greater, you can compare which numerical value of these ascii characters is greater. . Question 8 . Binary search is far quicker than sequential search because binary search inherently rules out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . Question 9 . Out of the list [64,36,16,11,9], I would be searching for 36. First I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and for the purpose of collegeboard that is the middle element), and 16 is less than 36, so I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/Tree2.png&quot;) display .

This code would display . &quot;The minimum number is&quot; . This is because minimum is defined, but minimum is never displayed, and as a result the minimum number is not shown . Problem 2 . The correct choice would be PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }. As it matches the formula (total T/ total D). . Problem 3 . False. This would not print anything out, as it does not display anything in the body of the procedure, and when the function is called it does not display the return value. . Problem 4 . Answer 1. This is because we calculate the total footprint individually, per flight, then complete the total by adding the two. Also answer 3 as answer 3 first finds each individually, then adds the two up. . hacks section 12-13 . Problems 1/2/3 . The first procedure would display the value 81*9 = 729, because c is 9, and b = 9*9 (9*2 or 81), and 81 9 | The second procedure would display 190, as temp becomes 110, then divided by 100 to be 1.1. Then the cost (173) is multiplied by 1.1 to give 190. | The third procedure equals 39.44, as first we subtract 32 then multiply by five-ninths. | . 3.13 Homework/Hacks for Part 1 and Part 2 of the lesson . def replaceRByards(toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames): if ((toprbyardspg/totalGames) &lt; (currentrbyards/totalGames)): toprbyardspg = currentrbyards print(toprbyardspg) replaceRByards(100, 1260, 12) . 1260 .

This will move the robot up, rotate it left. Then it moves up, rotates and moves right one extra, then the same, but to the left. Finally, it will move up one then move to the left one. Then it will move up 2 and move it right one. then it will go forwards, rotate right, then go forwards 2 through goForwardX . What is the correct name of the procedure? . A: PROCEDURE MYLIST. Technically, you can use the name MyList for a procedure, it is just that it still needs caps. using procedure in lowercase is not how collegeboard wants people to define procedures, and so PROCEDURE MYLIST (using full caps) is the best pick. . Second Robot Problem . PROCEDURE MoveForwardsUntil(direction, number){ while number != 0{ MOVE_FORWARD() if direction = right{ if not CAN_MOVE(right){ number -= 1 } } else if direction = left { if not CAN_MOVE(left){ number -= 1 } } } MOVE_FORWARD() } ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MoveForwardsUntil(right, 3) ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD . The procedure here decrements number by one every single time it passes a black block by checking whether it can move that way. That way, we can count to see how many black blocks we pass. Then the procedure makes the robot move one forward to ensure it is lined up. . Third Robot Problem . PROCEDURE FinishCourse(){ while not Goal_Completed{ if not CAN_MOVE(forward){ if CAN_MOVE(left){ ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() } else if CAN_MOVE(right) { ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() } else{ ROTATE_RIGHT() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() } } MOVE_FORWARD() } } FinishCourse() . This procedure works because it just asks the robot to move forward until it reaches an obstacle. If it does, then it check first to turn left (because in this case it is more optimal), then to turn right, at which it turns, moves up one (to dodge the obstacle) and then turns back to realign itself. This repeats until it reaches the top, at which point it turns left infinitely until it reaches the goal. . Extra: Creating and finishing my own course . Code to Complete Course . PROCEDURE TurnXDeg(times_To_turn){ for i in range(times_To_turn){ ROTATE_RIGHT() } } PROCEDURE goForwardX(X){ for i in range x { MOVE_FORWARD()) } } TurnXDeg(2) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(4) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(3) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(3) MOVE_FORWARD() TurnXDeg(1) goForward(2) . This just uses some simple compound function to repeat certain actions a certain amount of times to complete tasks. . from PIL import Image im = Image.open(&quot;../images/sugma.png&quot;) print(&quot;Course to Finish:&quot;) display(im) .

For example, changing the aesthetics of our project, adding more features such as a comment area, where you could comment on the different options of teams that we had. There especially was this one parent that questioned us about the mechanics and overall code and we were able to give them a satisfactory response and they gave us a suggestion on changing the colors of our site.

Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs . | Do not affect run speed . | . | Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else . Should include the origin or authors name . | . | . | Program Errors . Three types of errors can occur . Logic error . Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly . | . | Syntax Error . Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed . | . | Runtime Error .

Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs. . | variable length . Example . Colors . | Boolean logic . | Lists &amp; so on . | . | . | . | Some data may take many bits to represent it . For example: . 10 MP uses 10,000,000 pixels . 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits . | MP is one billion pixels . | . | This means that there are 8 bits * 6 bytes * 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture. . (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec) . | . | . | . | . | Abstractions . Bits are grouped to represent abstractions . EX: . Numbers . | Chars . | Colors . | &amp; so on . | . | . | Abstractions find common features to generalize the program . Helps to shrink code &amp; reduces the chance of error . | Example: . . | The programming language is an abstraction of machine code &amp; makes it easier to do stuff like add nums . | . | . | . | Analog vs digital data . Ananalog signal . has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals . | Ex: . Pitch . | Volume . | Colors . | Position of a sprinter during a race . | . | CONTINUOUS SIGNALS . | . | Digital signals . An analog signal that has been broken up into steps . | Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a sampling technique, . measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample . | . | . | . | . | (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction) . | Consequences of using bits to represent data . A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value . Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val . | EG: . Integer: 4 . | Real Number: 4.00 . | Boolean: True | False | . | String: “Novak the third” . | List: [1, 1, 35, 6] . | . | Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits . Limits the num range of int vals &amp; math operations on such values . | Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error . | AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer’s memory . | KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM . | . | . | . | Number Systems . Bin, decimal, &amp; hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data . | KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM . | . | . | Various Errors . Several diff types of erroos can occur: . Overflow Errors . In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits . | when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number . | EX: . On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7dec) . | Running smth like . x=7 . | Y = x++ . | . | Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw . | . | . | Run-time errors . A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run . EX: Accessing undeclared vars . | . | . | Roundoff errors . Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another . EX: ⅓ = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ⅓ 0.3333 on a diff comp . | . | . | . | . | Lossy and Lossless Data compressions . Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data . (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info) . | . | Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs . | Lossy Compression .

Patterns . | Trends . | Associations . | (can me bisinterpereted) . | (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists) . (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature) . | . | . | The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted . A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion . | Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion . | . | Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case) . | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size: . The need to clean data . Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything . | . | Incomplete data . | Invalid data . | The need to combine data sources . | . | Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications . (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools) . | EX: . Social media activity generates an enormous amount of data and uses a data processing application . | Too large to examine in hand in real-time . | . | bias is often created by the types and sources of data being collected. . not eliminated by simply collecting more data since a large amount of data collected by humans will always reflect this bias . | A large sample can magnify the bias associated with the data being used - can have little value if the sample is not representative of the population to which the results will be generalized . | . | . | . | PRedicting algorithms . Use info collected from big data to influence our daily lives . EX: . A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to extend or flag a purchase for possible fraud . | Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing habits . | . | . | . | Visualization of Data . Using appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can help one gain insight and knowledge .

Collum charts . | Line graphs . | Pie charts . | XY charts . | Radar charts . | Histograms . | waterfall charts . | EX: . this company notices that greater users =- more profit so they can spend more of their resources on advertisements and attracting more users . | . | . | . | Predicting trends is not a guarrantee of future usage . (dangeruous to solely make decisions on good data rather than all data) . | . | Use historical data to predict future events . Used to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends . This is used on current data to make predictions . | . | . | . | Privacy Concerns . Arise through mass collection of data . May contain personal info . Can affect choice in storage and transmitting . | . | . | Anything done online likely leads to the sharing of priv data . | (trade off for the convenience of online shopping is the risk of violating privacy) . | . | Metadata . data that describes data . | EX: . . | Pic of dog is data . | Filename, author, location, and time taken of this pic is metadata . | . | Used for finding, roganizing, and managing info . | Can Increase effective use of data by providing addition info ab varius aspects . | Do not change primary data . | . | .
