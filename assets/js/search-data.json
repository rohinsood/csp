            "content": "CSP Textbook Notes . Big Idea 1: Creative Development . Computing innovations . Inspiration to create this shit is found everywhereüòàüòàüòà . | Constantly changing &amp; improving . | Applied in many other fields . Simulations . Cost-effective . | Easier to do large num of tests . | Con: does not account for all real-world variables . | . | Health &amp; medicine . Data analytics or smth . | . | . | . | Hardware vs software . Physical components vs virtual instructions via programming lang . | Computing innovation is about the software . | Computing hardware has gotten smaller and more powerful over the years . | Examples . Software . OS . | Driverless vehicle software . | Dual monitor programs for windows . | Compiler . | Graphics card driver . | . | Hardware . Motherboard . | Self-driving car . | Monitor . | Transistor . | Graphics card . | . | . | . | Collaboration . Helps people learn from each other . Diverse perspectives that avoid bias in computing development . For example, if the product is used by short and tall people, hiring only tall people to work on the product could bring bias; hiring both short and tall people brings new perspectives that may not have been achieved otherwise . | . | Companies hire ppl who can code and have good collaboration skills . | Effective collaboration can help one gain insight and knowledge by applying multiple perspectives, experiences, and skillsets . | . | Collaboration is a learned skill . Includes communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, &amp; negotiation . | . | Collaboration can make others more self-aware . Matches weaknesses with someone elses strengths -&gt; better product and new insight . | . | Facilitates the solving of computational problems by applying multiple perspectives and skill sets . Combines different peoples resources. Talents &amp; experiences . | . | Not limited by location . Current computational tools allow people in diff physical locations to share data &amp; info . | . | . | How programs function . Program is often referred to as software . A collection of prgram statements that perform a specific task when run byt hte computer . | Software is a set of instructions data or pgrams used to operate computers and execute specific tasks . | . | Difficult to determine if a program works for every condition . | Programmers can never have too many test cases . Logical errors demonstrate why collaboration si so important in programming . | Common that a fresh set of eyes will be better than an entrenched programmer . | . | A complex program can be described broadly by what it does . Keeping the program abstract helps the user focus on using the program instead of looking at the code . . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction, doesn‚Äôt show the user how it works . | . | . | Program Input . This is data sent to a computer for processing by a program . Can come in multiple forms: . Tactile . User interaction . | . | Audio . | Visual . | Text . | . | Example of input/output . . | User says ‚Äúhey phone‚Äù - triggers an event . The action that supplies input data to a program . Key press . | Mouse click . | Program is started . | Anu other dewfinmed action taht affects the flow of execution . | . | . | . | . | . | Development process . Can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature . A development process that is iterative requires refine ment and revisions based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process, this may require revisiting earlier phases of the process . #1) investigating and reflecting ‚Ü° . | #2 designing ‚Ü° . | #3) prototyping ‚Ü° . | #4) testing ‚Üª . | . | Example . #1) due to location restrictions, there is a large need for an effective way of communicating with a team . | #2) design the steps needed to develop the multiple algorithms that allow for certain functionalities such as video conferencing . | #3) write the program . | #4) Execute the program to find errors . | This process will be repeated until an acceptable product is reached or the programmer just runs out of time . | . | . | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem ito smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole . A program rarely works on the first development and breaking it into smaller parts of the code reduces the debugging process . | . | Once they work, add the small chunks of code together to form the bigger program . | . | The DESIGN of a program incorporates investigations to determine its reqs . Most programs are for ppl not progs and to meet the needs of ppl, investigation mus tidentify the prgram constraints &amp; the concerns and interested of people who will uise the program . | Example of perfomraing investigation . Colecting data in surveys . | User testing . | Interviews . | Direct observations . | . | Example of design phase . Brainstorming . | Planning and storyboarding . | Organizing the program into modules and function components . | Creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface . | Developing a testing strat for the program . | . | . | . | Program Documentation . A written desc of the func of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed . | Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming envs . Progs should document a program throughout its development - helps them rember what they were thinking . | . | Comments . Form of program docs written in otthj epgram that do not affect how the program runs . | Do not affect run speed . | . | Can be used to acknowledge code segments written by someone else . Should include the origin or authors name . | . | . | Program Errors . Three types of errors can occur . Logic error . Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly . | . | Syntax Error . Mistake in the program where the rules of hte programming lang are not followed . | . | Runtime Error . Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program . | Prog langs define their own runtime errors . | . | . | . | . Big Idea 2: Data . Bits represent data . Bit . Shorthand for a single binary digit and is etierh 0 or 1 . | . | Byte . 8 bits . | 0111 0011 - contains 1 byte and 8 bits . | . | Binary sequences . Can be used to represent all digital data/Anything that can be stored on a computer can be repped as by bin. seqs. . | variable length . Example . Colors . | Boolean logic . | Lists &amp; so on . | . | . | . | Some data may take many bits to represent it . For example: . 10 MP uses 10,000,000 pixels . 1 pixel stores 6 bytes - 48 bits . | MP is one billion pixels . | . | This means that there are 8 bits * 6 bytes * 10m pixels - 480,000,000 bits in a single 10 MP picture. . (common for videos to use 1,00,000 bits/sec) . | . | . | . | . | Abstractions . Bits are grouped to represent abstractions . EX: . Numbers . | Chars . | Colors . | &amp; so on . | . | . | Abstractions find common features to generalize the program . Helps to shrink code &amp; reduces the chance of error . | Example: . . | The programming language is an abstraction of machine code &amp; makes it easier to do stuff like add nums . | . | . | . | Analog vs digital data . Ananalog signal . has values that change smoothly over time, rather than in discrete intervals . | Ex: . Pitch . | Volume . | Colors . | Position of a sprinter during a race . | . | CONTINUOUS SIGNALS . | . | Digital signals . An analog signal that has been broken up into steps . | Analog data can closely approximate digital data using a sampling technique, . measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample . | . | . | . | . | (the use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of an abstraction) . | Consequences of using bits to represent data . A variable is an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value . Each variable had associated data storage that represents one value, or can hold multiple vals inside of a larger val . | EG: . Integer: 4 . | Real Number: 4.00 . | Boolean: True | False | . | String: ‚ÄúNovak the third‚Äù . | List: [1, 1, 35, 6] . | . | Integers are most often represented by a fix number of bits . Limits the num range of int vals &amp; math operations on such values . | Surpassing this limit throws an overflow error . | AP Lang DOES NOT have num size limit - size of representable ints is limited ONLY by the szie of the computer‚Äôs memory . | KNOW THAT SOME COMPUTER LANGS HAVE LIMITS ONT HE SIZE OF DATA TYPES FOR EXAM . | . | . | . | Number Systems . Bin, decimal, &amp; hexadec, are all used to represent and investigate digital data . | KNOW HOW TO CONVERT BIN TO DEC AND DEC TO BIN FOR EXAM . | . | . | Various Errors . Several diff types of erroos can occur: . Overflow Errors . In many programming langs, a fixed num of bits is used to rep characters or int limits . | when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number . | EX: . On a 4-bit computer (largest num is 1111 or 7dec) . | Running smth like . x=7 . | Y = x++ . | . | Returns an overflow error cuz its too large heheheaw . | . | . | Run-time errors . A mistake in a program that happens when the program is run . EX: Accessing undeclared vars . | . | . | Roundoff errors . Occurs when decimals (real nums) are rounded, one comp might round to a diff place than another . EX: ‚Öì = 0.3333333333333333333 on one comp OR ‚Öì 0.3333 on a diff comp . | . | . | . | . | Lossy and Lossless Data compressions . Reducing the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data . (fewer bits does not necessarily mean less info) . | . | Digital data compression often involves trade-offs in quality versus storage reqs . | Lossy Compression . Can significantly reduce the file size for storage and transmission . | Trade-off is that u will not recover the original file &amp; SOME data will always be lost . | Used in sitch where minimizing transmission time &amp; data size is important . | . | Lossless Compression . NO DATA IS LOST . | Trade off is larger files that can be harder to store, transfer, and handle . | Used in sitch where quality or ability to reconstruct the orig file is important . | . | . | . | Information Extracted from Data . Computer programs can be used to process info &amp; gain insight &amp; knowledge . Info can include digital data such as . Geographic data . | Premium data on social med sites based on usage . | . | . | Information . The collection of facts and patterns extracted from data . | . | Gaining insight from the above valuable involves a combination of‚Ä¶ . Statistics . | Mathematics . | Programming . | And problem solving . | . | Large data sets may be analyzed computationally to reveal‚Ä¶ . Patterns . | Trends . | Associations . | (can me bisinterpereted) . | (May show correlation between vars, does not mean a relationship exists) . (additional research is needed to determine the exact nature) . | . | . | The size of the data sets often affects the amount of info that can be extracted . A single source does often does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion . | Combining data from a variety of sources may be necessary to have a conclusion . | . | Depending on how the data was collected, the info may not be uniform (varying from test case to test case) . | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size: . The need to clean data . Makes the data standardized (uniform) without needing to change anything . | . | Incomplete data . | Invalid data . | The need to combine data sources . | . | Data can get too large for traditional data-processing applications . (ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools) . | EX: . Social media activity generates an enormous amount of data and uses a data processing application . | Too large to examine in hand in real-time . | . | bias is often created by the types and sources of data being collected. . not eliminated by simply collecting more data since a large amount of data collected by humans will always reflect this bias . | A large sample can magnify the bias associated with the data being used - can have little value if the sample is not representative of the population to which the results will be generalized . | . | . | . | PRedicting algorithms . Use info collected from big data to influence our daily lives . EX: . A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to extend or flag a purchase for possible fraud . | Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing habits . | . | . | . | Visualization of Data . Using appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can help one gain insight and knowledge . Data can lose their value if they cannot be presented in a way that can be interpreted . | . | Can communicate info about data &amp; make more complex data easier to interperet . Collum charts . | Line graphs . | Pie charts . | XY charts . | Radar charts . | Histograms . | waterfall charts . | EX: . this company notices that greater users =- more profit so they can spend more of their resources on advertisements and attracting more users . | . | . | . | Predicting trends is not a guarrantee of future usage . (dangeruous to solely make decisions on good data rather than all data) . | . | Use historical data to predict future events . Used to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends . This is used on current data to make predictions . | . | . | . | Privacy Concerns . Arise through mass collection of data . May contain personal info . Can affect choice in storage and transmitting . | . | . | Anything done online likely leads to the sharing of priv data . | (trade off for the convenience of online shopping is the risk of violating privacy) . | . | Metadata . data that describes data . | EX: . . | Pic of dog is data . | Filename, author, location, and time taken of this pic is metadata . | . | Used for finding, roganizing, and managing info . | Can Increase effective use of data by providing addition info ab varius aspects . | Do not change primary data . | . | .

Reduce complexity . | Allow for efficient design . | &amp; implementation of complex systems . | . | GUI is an example of abstraction . | . | Math OPerators . . | . | Modulus Notes . If the dividend is a multiple of the divisor, then the return val is 0 . | If the dividend is smaller than the divisor, then the return val is the dividend itself . | If teh divisor is 0, an ERROR is thrown . | If 0 is the dividend, the return val is 0 . | . | Lists . START AT INDEX 1 . | Example of data abstraction . | . | Relational and Bool Operators . . | . | Searching . Linear search (sequential search) . Finds an element in sorted or unsorted list .

The breaking down and assembly of packets at each end . | The middle is hidden by abstraction . | EXAMPLE: . . | There are a multitude of paths that packets can take to travel between D (sender) and k(reciever) . Since there are multiple paths, packets are likely to arrive at the receiver out of order . | . | If packets are not received, TCP will request the sender to resent the pissing packet . The IP of the send. And reciv. Are both in the header of the packet . | . | When all packets are received, then the message will be reconstructed using their order found in the header . | . | . | . | Difference between internet and world wide web .

Some transition metals have constant charges . | . | . | Boron has -6 charge . | Berryllium needs 2.4 . | Only aqueous solutions can be acids and bases . | Anything with hydroxide (OH, HO) are bases . | Acids are covalent compounds . When submerged in water, hydrogen can become positively charged and create an acid . | H+ in a molecular compound is an Acid . | . | Water (H2O) can be both acids and bases . Amphoteric is the term used to describe this . | . | Percent yield is real/theoretical . . | . | Limiting reactant quicker .

Anything that gains electrons is reduced . | . | . | Oxidation numbers/states (assigned per atom) . Used to find what is oxidizing or reduced . | 1. Look at freelements . Any free elements are given oxidation number of 0 . O2 has oxidation num of 0 because there is nothing attached to the element . | . | . | 2. Look at the monoatomic ions . The hcarge of the ion is the oxidation number . Na+ has oxidation num of +1 . | O2- has oxidation num of -2 . | . | . | 3. Polyatomic ion/compound = ox#s have to add up to the charge . Ox num of each element must add up to the charge . | NO3 . | . | 4. Compounds: . alkali metals: +1 ox # . | Alkaline earth metals: +2 ox # . | F: -1 ox # . The above three are constant . | . | H: +1 ox # . | H (With a metal): -1 ox # . | O: -2 ox # . | Halogens: -1 . these will vary to elements above them . Eg a halogen will vary to an oxygen . | . | | . | . | . | H2O . H is not w/ a metal so its harge is +1 . There are 2 H atoms . Charge is +2 . | . | . | Oxygen is -2 charge . | Net charge is +2 + (-2) -&gt; 0 . | . | If ixizidation number increases, it becomes oxidized . Li -&gt; li+ + e- . Li has charge o 0 since it is a free element . | Li+ gains an electron . Oxidizes . | . | . | . | Subcript is hte number of atoms . Hg2^+2 . Ox num of 1 since the net charge of this is 2 and oxidation num is per element . | . | . | . | BALANCE an equation (combining) . ¬Ω rxns . One ¬Ω at a time . Balance all elements except H &amp; O . | Balance all O by adding h20 . | Balance all H by adding h+ . | Balance charge by adding e- . | . | Repeat for 2nd ¬Ω rxn . | Add both ¬Ω rxns . ELECTRONS MUST CANCEL OUT (multiply by a coefficient toriase) . | Charges should be the same on both sides . | . | Cancel when the same element is on both sides of the equation . This means that the element doesn‚Äôt react so it is un . | . | . | . | When the same element undergoes reduction and oxidation, the reaction is a disproportionation reaction . . Since ox num hydrogen stays the same, oxygen is being reduced in 2h2O and oxidated in O2 &gt; mens that only 2H2O takes part in reduction and oxidation . | . | . In this instance, because the ox nums of H and O stay the same, it does not take part in reduction and oxidation and is ignored when writing the half equations . | . | . | . | DILUTION EQUATIONS .

Net atomic number of prods &amp; reacftants have to match . | Net charge of prods &amp; reactants have to match . | . | . Net mass of reactants and net mass of prods must be equal . U can subtract the mass of 4-2-He from the net mass of the reactants to find the remainder . | . | . | . | . | Example of AP Chem nuclear chem equation . . | Multiple steps . decay 2 consecutive alpha decays . | Followed by a beta decay . | Followed by another alpha decay . These steps are shown by arrows that take the result of one decay to result of another decay . | . | . | . | Half-life is the tiem it take for an element to decay half of its original mass . 100g - 50g takes 30 days, 25 to 17.5g = 30 days . | . | All radio active rxns are always 1st order . 1st order means that the speed of hte equation depends on the concentration of the reactants . This means that hte half life will stay constant with varying masses . 1 concentration / 1 speed = .5 concentration / .5 speed . | . | . | Isotopic decay means that the reaction is radioactive . | . | Organic chemistry . Organic involves organisms . Carbon cannot create 4 bonds with itself . . | Tetrahedron structure of a carbon has only 3 bonds &amp; 1 bond facing the other way . | . | Hydrocarbons are the base of all organisms . Pure hydrocarbons have only hydrogen and carbon . | Alyphatic . Compounds can be‚Ä¶ . Straight . Where the structure is straight like a line . | . | . | Ring . | Branched . . | The base is the # of carbon atoms within the largest chain . | The example is a 7 carbon atom base . | . | . | Naming alyphatic . . Prefix - substituents (aka functional groups) . Prefixes for the num of the same substituant . . | Used when more than one hydrogens are replaced by the same substituent . | . | There can be more than one substiuent . . | . | When something replaces hydrogen . | . | Must give place of substituents . | . In the example, you would name it 4-methyl octane (4 is the number of the carbon in which it bonds with) . | Must choose the lowest position . | . | If there is another hydrocarbon, the suffix is the hydrocarbon . ONLY IF THE HYDROCARBON IS NOT PART OF A CHAIN . | . | Eg: methyl octane . | . | Naming a hydrocarbon substituent . Only worry about its base/ num of carbon atoms . | -yl is the suffix always . | . | . Amines are weak bases . | . | . Creates COOH . | Called ethanoic acid . | (an means it is alkide) . | -oic is the suffix of the acoid . | . | If functional groups are on opposite sides/the same side they are named differently . . | . | . | Base - # of carbon atoms . . | 4 is ‚Äúbut‚Äù but is pronounced beaut like in beauty . | . | Suffix - family . -ane (single bond alkanes) . | -ene (at least one double bond alkines) . | -yne (at least one triple bond alkene) . | . | . | . | . In this instance the substiuent is the leftmost hc cuz the longest chain goes from the top to the right . | Because counting from top to right has the carbon bonded with the substituent . | . | . | . | Aromatic . Benzene based . | ‚ÄúThese compounds can be found chiefly in crude oil and natural gases.

Salt Bridge is most likely KNO3 . | . | . Zn is still a catho and will lose its electrons to give to copper, this makes the copper solute on the left side more positive than the left side . The electrons are attracted by the cathode manually put by the scientists &amp; go to the copper . | Creates Zn2+ in th eleft chamber . | . | Since copper is a cathode &amp; has positive charge, the negative charge of the electrons cancels out the cathode and makes it neutralized . | Because the left chamber is hence more positively charged than the right, KNO3 is split apart and sent to the two chambers . K^- charge is sent to the Zn chamber . | NO^3- charge is sent toth Cu chamber . | . | . | . If the reactants increase, then the eq will shift to the right in the way of the products &amp; hence the cell potential (E¬∞) would increase . | . | . Because Q increases with greater products, and a greater Q means a smaller log of Q, that means a smaller number is subtracted from E¬∞cell &amp; hence ECell would decrease . | . | . | .

Homo Spaien . | . | . | . | . | Ch 22.2 (7.1 &amp; 7.3) . Descent with modification by natural selection explains the adaptations of organisms and the unity and diversity of life . Darwin left England to observe plants and animals along the the South American coast . | Charles Darwin proposed that the mechanism of evolution is natural selection and that it explains how adaptations arise. What are adaptations? . | Observed fossils through natural changes . earfquakes . | . | Darwin observed examples of adaptations . Inherited cahracteristscs of organisms . enhance theri survival and reproduction in specific environments . | . | Explained how adaptations arose throught he process of Natural selection . Key features . Indiivudals do not evolve but populations over time . | Nat selec can amplify or dimisn only heritable traits taht differ . If only one trait exists, nat selec cannot occur . | . | Enviornmental factors vary from place to place &amp; over time. Nat selec always takes place but the favored traits depends on the environment in which a species mates . | | . | Explain the process of natural selection. . | Individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at high rates than do other individuals . Because of those traits. . | . | . | Explain how adaptations, like the beaks of these finches, arise through natural selection. . The finches who were born with alleles better suited for their environment were more likely to survive and reproduce, and hence pass on their genes, than finches who were born with different alleles. A finch with the genes for a larger beak were more likely to survive in an environment with cacti than other birds with different genes. . | . | . | Darwin viewed the history of life as a tree . Branchings from a common trunk . Twigs today . | . | . Labeled twigs are species alive today . | Unnamed are extinct . | . | Branching process explains the variation that exist between related groups of organisms . | . | Artificial Selection . Explain artificial selection, and describe how it led Darwin to his notion of natural selection. . Humans selecting desired traits through breeding inspired Darwin to connect a similar process that happened naturally . | . | Humans selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals to encourage the occurrence of desirable traits . As a result, crops, livestock animals, pets often are dissimilar to their wild ancestors . | . | . | Argued that a similar process of human artificial selection happened in nature . Based on two core observations . Members of a population often vary in their inherited traits . Individuals with traits that help them survive and reproduce tend to leave more offspring than do other individuals . | Use this picture to describe Darwin‚Äôs observation #1: Variations in traits exist. These variations (traits) are heritable. Identify some other examples? . Traits that help an organism survive are more likely to produce offspring with such traits . | Black bears &amp; brown bears . | . | . | All species can produce more offspring than their enviornmetn can support &amp; many of these offspring die and fail to reproduce . Unequal ability of iniduvlas to survive and reproduce will lead to an abundance of favorable traits . | Use this picture to describe Darwin‚Äôs observation #2: Species overproduce. There is competition for resources and not all offspring survive. All species have this capability, even humans. Explain. . | . Because not all offspring can survive due to competition to attain resources, the offspring with traits better suited for an environment will survive &amp; reproduce offspring such traits. . | . | . | Heritable Traits . capable of being inherited or of passing by inheritance . | Infeunce an organisms own performance &amp; its offsprings . | . | . | . | . | Artificial vs Natural .
