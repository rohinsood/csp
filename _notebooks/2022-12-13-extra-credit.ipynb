    "# My Reflection/takeaways\n",
    " - When the speakers were asked about, when they were in high school, if they thought they would be at the place that they are in life at this moment, I found it especially particular that neither of them thought they would be. Although its important to think about one's future and life goals, its also important to note that, as time progresses, one's ideals and goals in life progress as well. You won't know where you'll end up in 10, 15, 20, 30 years and its important to realize to live and invest in the present. \n",
