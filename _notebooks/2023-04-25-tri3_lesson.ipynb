    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    " - What is NumPy and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "   - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in data analysis because of its ability to efficiently perform numerical operations on large data sets. It also provides tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. NumPy is often used in combination with other data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    " - What is Pandas and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "   - Pandas is a Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides a flexible and high-performance data structure called a DataFrame, which is similar to a table in a relational database. Pandas is used for tasks such as cleaning and filtering data, handling missing values, and grouping and aggregating data. It also provides tools for reading and writing data from and to a variety of file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    " - How is NumPy different than Pandas for data analysis?\n",
    "   - NumPy and Pandas are both used in data analysis, but they have different purposes. NumPy is primarily used for numerical computations and working with multi-dimensional arrays, while Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, and working with tabular data in the form of DataFrames. NumPy is more focused on the mathematical and scientific aspects of data analysis, while Pandas provides a higher-level interface for working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "   - A DataFrame is a data structure in Pandas that represents tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type. DataFrames provide a flexible and powerful way to manipulate and analyze data, with built-in support for tasks such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - What are some common operations you can perform with NumPy?\n",
    "   - NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions that can be used to operate on arrays and matrices. Some common operations include:\n",
    "     - Performing arithmetic operations on arrays (e.g., addition, multiplication)\n",
    "     - Finding the minimum, maximum, and mean values of an array\n",
    "     - Reshaping, slicing, and indexing arrays\n",
    "     - Transposing and concatenating arrays\n",
    "     - Performing matrix operations such as dot product, eigenvalue calculation, and inverse calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "How Can You Incorporate Either of these Data Analysis Tools (NunPy, Pandas) into your project?\n",
    " - I am not taking the AP CSP exam but I can use data analysis tools such as NunPy and Pandas to filter data within my database to create a frontend user management system with necessary information. I can filter the passwords column because that is unecessary for a user attempting to manage other users\n",
