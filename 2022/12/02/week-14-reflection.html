<ul>
  <li>I recieved a 0.7/1.0
    <ul>
      <li>Although I was initially shoked, I believe that this score is ultimately reflective of my attention to detail, however, it is unfreflective of my effort and learnings. I believe I deserve a 0.9/1.0
        <ul>
          <li>When reading over the prompts, I missed a few of the tasks assigned to me and completely forgot to complete them. In my blog, however, I wrote a quick paragraph about what I learned from the lesson.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I can improve on this by spending more time on each assignment and paying closer attention to detail
        <h1 id="lesson-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#lesson-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lesson 2</h1>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I recieved a 0.95/1.0
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that this score is honestly reflective of the ideas and learnings i developed during this lesson.
        <ul>
          <li>I put in a large amount of time into answering their prompt and made sure to get to every prompt assigned unlike the last one.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I can improve by adding more detail to my answers and explaining why something may or may not be correct.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
