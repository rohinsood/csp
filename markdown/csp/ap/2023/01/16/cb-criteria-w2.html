<p>There was a difference between how I graded a student’s work and how the CollegeBoard graded it. I gave the student a point for explaining the purpose and function of their program . I think that, along with their extra explanation, met the requirements for the overall goal of the program. To make sure I understand this requirement, I will clearly explain what my program does and all of its parts. I will use special words to show my knowledge about the topic. A student’s work may not meet this requirement if they don’t explain how their program works and what it gives as an output. They got a 0 out of 1 because there is no half credit.</p>

<p>I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for this performance task submission. The student criteria required nd had the necessary code and explanations to achieve this score. In my own work, I will ensure that I create mutliple procedures with parameters to manipulate lists. Lists are a large part of the CollegeBoard APCSP requirements, so I’ll add lots of data abstraction methods using them. There is no partial credit awarded, so I will make sure to follow every single requirement exactly. The student who created this CPT did just that.</p>

<p>There were no major discrepancies between my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring of the student’s work as it was scored objectively according to the rubric. In order for my program to fulfill all the requirements, specifically for Program Purpose and Function (which this student lacked), I will ensure that I describe the overall purpose of my program in a clear and concise manner, properly describe and showcase its functionality in my video, and highlight the inputs and outputs within the program. This specific submission recieved a 0 in this category because it failed to meet these criteria—its description of the program was very barebones and did not warrant a score of 1/1.</p>

<p>I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for the 2nd performance task submission. In order to fulfill the requirements that this submission failed to meet, I will make sure to discuss how I manage complexity in my program. In my feature for this week’s hacks, I managed complexity in many different ways and I think I can comprehensively explain it to make it clear to CollegeBoard why I deserve full points. I used many functions and data abstraction methods to make my code cleaner. This submission failed to meet this standard because it did not explicitly mention why certain procedures were implemented with the goal of reducing program complexity, something required by the CollegeBoard standards.</p>
